## Alien land laws

### Overview

Alien land laws historically have been discriminatory measures used to restrict property ownership rights of specific ethnic or national groups. This comprehensive set of Texas bills represents a modern iteration of such discriminatory legislation, primarily targeting Chinese nationals and entities, along with some other designated countries.

These bills create an extensive framework of restrictions that significantly impact Chinese individuals and entities in Texas:

Property Purchase Restrictions:
- Multiple bills (HB17, HB191, HB402, HB1566, HB1849, HB2389, HB2536, HB2752, HB4296, HB4597, HB4606, SB17, SB103, SB307) explicitly prohibit Chinese nationals, government entities, and Chinese-controlled organizations from purchasing real property in Texas.
- Agricultural land faces particular scrutiny, with HB518, HB1743, SB1063 specifically restricting foreign ownership of farmland, with SB1063 specifically addressing land up to 5 acres.
- HB4597 and HB4606 add restrictions on property within 25 miles of critical infrastructure, commercial property, and multi-family housing.

Enforcement and Penalties:
- HB243 authorizes property seizure through eminent domain near critical infrastructure.
- HB733 requires citizenship verification for residential property purchases.
- Bills like HB1849 impose severe penalties, including criminal charges and fines.
- New homeland security review committees (HB4597, HB4606) will approve/disapprove transactions.

Additional Restrictions and Deadlines:
- HB546 affects tax benefits for foreign-owned open-space land.
- HB2034 restricts groundwater permits for entities from designated countries.
- HB2628 requires existing foreign-owned properties to be divested by March 1, 2026.
- HB1743 forces non-resident Chinese citizens to divest their property by 2027.
- HB2389 and SB103 additionally prohibit Chinese entities from entering contracts with Texas government entities.
- Properties owned before September 2025 are generally grandfathered under newer bills (HB4597, HB4606).

While many bills exempt U.S. citizens and permanent residents of Chinese descent, these laws create a hostile environment for Chinese nationals, students, and temporary workers in Texas. The legislation could affect:
- Chinese students' housing options
- Chinese businesses' operations and government contracts
- Chinese professionals on work visas
- Chinese agricultural investments
- Property values of existing Chinese-owned properties
- Access to groundwater rights
- Tax burden on agricultural and open-space land
- Properties near critical infrastructure

This legislative package represents a discriminatory approach that could lead to broader anti-Chinese sentiment and affect the Chinese-American community, even those exempt from these restrictions.


### Translation

外国人土地法历来是一种歧视性措施，用于限制特定族裔或国籍群体的财产所有权。这套德克萨斯州法案代表了此类歧视性立法的现代版本，主要针对中国公民和实体，以及其他一些指定国家。

这些法案建立了一个广泛的限制框架，严重影响在德克萨斯州的中国个人和实体：

房地产购买限制：
- 多项法案(HB17, HB191, HB402等)明确禁止中国公民、政府实体和中国控制的组织在德克萨斯州购买房地产。
- 农业用地受到特别审查，HB518、HB1743、SB1063特别限制外国人拥有农田，其中SB1063具体针对5英亩以下的土地。
- HB4597和HB4606增加了对关键基础设施25英里范围内的物业、商业地产和多户住宅的限制。

执法和处罚：
- HB243授权通过征用权没收靠近关键基础设施的房产。
- HB733要求验证购买住宅物业者的公民身份。
- 如HB1849等法案施加严厉处罚，包括刑事指控和罚款。
- 新的国土安全审查委员会将审批交易。

额外限制和期限：
- HB546影响外国人拥有的开放空间土地的税收优惠。
- HB2034限制指定国家实体的地下水许可。
- HB2628要求现有外国人拥有的房产在2026年3月1日前出售。
- HB1743强制非居民中国公民在2027年前出售其房产。
- HB2389和SB103还禁止中国实体与德州政府实体签订合同。
- 2025年9月前拥有的房产通常可以在新法案下保留。

虽然许多法案豁免了具有中国血统的美国公民和永久居民，但这些法律为在德克萨斯州的中国公民、学生和临时工作者创造了一个敌对环境。这些立法可能影响：
- 中国学生的住房选择
- 中国企业的运营和政府合同
- 持工作签证的中国专业人士
- 中国农业投资
- 现有中国人拥有房产的价值
- 地下水权获取
- 农业和开放空间土地的税收负担
- 靠近关键基础设施的房产

这套立法方案代表了一种歧视性做法，可能导致更广泛的反华情绪，并影响中美社区，即使是那些豁免于这些限制的人。

### Talking Points Against SB17
**SB 17 is un-American and anti-Texan.  Let’s keep Texas open for business.** 

1. **Harm to Texas Economy & Reputation**

    * **Disruption to Real Estate Markets**: Banning property ownership by foreign individuals and companies would destabilize real estate transactions across commercial, industrial, residential, and agricultural markets.  
    
    * **Excessive Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Compliance with SB 17 would introduce unnecessary red tape, leading to delays, increased transaction costs, and making Texas a less attractive place for investment and growth.  
    
    * **Impact on Major Trading Partners**: Texas' key trading partners—responsible for tens of billions in annual trade—would face unnecessary restrictions, diminishing international business and economic relationships. (Mainland China is Texas’ 3rd largest trading partner, which imported $26.467 billion from Texas in 2024\.)  
    
    * **Risk of Job Losses and Economic Setback**: Restricting property purchases would create a hostile environment for investors and entrepreneurs, prompting them to choose or relocate to more welcoming states, which could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth. This runs counter to Texas' ongoing efforts to stimulate economic development.  
    
    * **Discouraging Skilled Foreign Talent**: SB 17 would discourage high-skilled foreign talent from coming to Texas, weakening the state's competitive edge in technology, manufacturing and other sectors.  
    
    * **Hurting Existing Texas Businesses**: Many existing Texas businesses would like to bring their upstream supply chains and reshore manufacturing to Texas to make them more competitive.  Texas could become a manufacturing powerhouse.  However, SB 17 runs counter to such efforts, hurting existing Texas businesses and making Texas less attractive for corporate relocation.    
    
    * **Damage to Texas’ Pro-Business Reputation**: This bill threatens Texas’ image as a pro-business hub, potentially pushing businesses to relocate to states with a more favorable climate for investment and innovation.  
    
    * **Texas' Legacy at Stake**: Texas should continue to champion its legacy as a leader in innovation, commerce, and economic prosperity, not impose unnecessary, harmful restrictions. We must protect the state’s “Open for Business” reputation.  
    
2. **SB 17 Will Not Achieve Its Stated Goals**  
     
    * The bill claims to “protect key land and natural resources from hostile counties and their actors” and to ensure national security.  However, there is no clear evidence to support that restricting property ownership will achieve these objectives.  
    
3. **Unclear Definitions and Practical Challenges**  
     
    * **Overly Broad Definition of Agricultural Land**: The bill defines “agricultural land” too broadly, leaving it unclear who will determine whether property is “suitable” for plant production or animal farming.  Many Texans grow their own fruits or raise animals on their properties for personal use, yet the broad definition could subject such properties to SB 17’s restrictions.  Additionally, properties leased for agricultural or farming purposes to gain agricultural tax exemptions but are otherwise located in the urban areas could be negatively impacted.  
    
    * **Expansion of Property Restrictions**: SB 17 now includes *commercial, industrial, and residential properties* under its restrictions, expanding beyond the provisions of SB 147 from 2023\.  However, there’s no evidence suggesting foreign ownership of these properties poses a national security threat.  The bill’s scope is overly broad and doesn’t align with its stated objectives.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around the Leasehold Exception**: The leasehold exception is confusing.  It is unclear what “improvements constructed on a leasehold” means.  
    
    * **Vague Definitions of “Risk”**: The bill includes terms such as “corporate espionage” and “public nuisance” under the definition of “risk to public health, safety, and welfare.”  How these will be determined is unclear, leaving too much room for interpretation and creating uncertainty.  An objective, justifiable test for “risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public” would be needed.   
    
    * **Nonsensical Provisions on “Bodily Injury”**: The bill also includes restrictions based on bodily injury, including introducing a dangerous disease or substance into an area.  This could lead to absurd situations where property owners are forced to sell their property due to minor incidents like a slip and fall or the common flu—undermining legal fairness.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around Domicile**: The bill restricts property ownership for individuals "domiciled" in certain countries but fails to define “domicile,” creating confusion.  Under Texas law, domicile is typically based on physical presence and intent to stay permanently, yet federal immigration laws prevent certain visa holders (e.g., H-1B employment visa, F-1 student visa) from establishing domicile in the U.S.  It could take over ten years for a Chinese national with an H1-B employment visa to become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.  The bill makes the bill overly broad and unnecessarily burdensome for lawful residents working in and contributing to Texas economy.    
    
    * **Unaddressed Practical Issues**: Issues like inheritance, foreclosure, and foreign nationals’ collateral property ownership are not adequately addressed, which could lead to significant financial and legal complications.  
    
    * **Harsh Consequences for Violations**: The bill’s “forced sale” provision for violations is overly punitive, risking devastating financial losses and legal disputes.  
    
    * **Lack of Certainty**: The bill’s ambiguity and lack of pre-clearance mechanisms for transactions could deter foreign investments and talent from choosing Texas as their home or business location.  
    
    * **Lack of Protection for Service Providers**: The bill does not provide protection for title companies, real estate agents, attorneys and other service providers involved in real estate transactions.  This would create a chilling effect on these service providers.

4. **Violates Federal Preemption and the Constitution**

    * **Federal Oversight of Foreign Purchases**: The federal government already regulates foreign property transactions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), making Texas’ attempt to impose additional restrictions unconstitutional and legally void.  
    
    * **Legal Enforceability Issues**: Federal preemption prevents states from enacting conflicting or supplementary laws in areas already federally regulated, rendering SB 17 legally unenforceable.  
    
5. **Unjustified Association Between Individuals and Governments**  
     
    * **Punishing Individuals for Their Governments' Actions**: The bill unfairly targets individuals based on their home country’s government actions, contradicting American values of individual responsibility and equal protection under the law. Those individuals and businesses make the choice to call Texas home.   
    
    * **Dangerous Precedents**: This mirrors historical injustices such as Japanese internment during WWII, setting a dangerous precedent for racial and ethnic discrimination.  
    
6. **Likely Legal Violations**

    SB 17 discriminates based on national origin, violating several federal and state laws, including:

    * 14th Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)  
    
    * Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 3a (Prohibits discrimination based on national origin)  
    
    * Fair Housing Act (Prohibits housing discrimination)  
    
    * WTO Agreements (Potential violation of international trade laws)  
    
7. **Broader Discriminatory and Social Implications**

    * **Fostering Xenophobia**: By targeting specific nationalities, the bill fosters racial profiling, increasing discrimination against all Asian Americans—not just Chinese Americans—due to perceived ethnic similarity. This could lead to negative economic and social consequences for the AAPI community in Texas, including those born in Texas and U.S. citizens.  
    
    * **Dividing Communities**: The bill unjustly equates lawful immigrants with national security threats, creating an environment of fear, suspicion, and division among Texans.   
    
8. **Lessons from History**

    * **Repeating Past Mistakes**: Texas had alien land laws back in the 19-20th century restricting foreign land ownership but the state legislature abolished them in 1965 “on the grounds that they imposed **unreasonable and discriminatory restrictions** on alien ownership and militated against efforts by the state to entice foreign investment and stimulate economic development and industrial growth.”  Enacting SB 17 would repeat past mistakes and undo decades of progress, reversing Texas’ global standing and economic growth.  
    
    * **Learning from the Past**: Texas must learn from its own history and reject SB 17 to maintain its legacy as a beacon of opportunity, economic strength, and global leadership.  Keep Texas open for business\! 

## Education

### Overview

Education bills typically focus on curriculum standards, funding allocation, and student eligibility criteria. However, this set of Texas bills reveals a concerning pattern of restrictions targeting international students and foreign academic connections, with particular implications for Chinese immigrants and students.

Several bills (HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324, HB371, HB4707, HB4886, HB5371) systematically restrict unauthorized immigrants from qualifying for in-state tuition or accessing public education. Schools must charge non-resident tuition rates, report undocumented students, and may deny admission. These changes significantly impact Chinese students without proper documentation by substantially increasing their education costs or completely barring their access to education.

Multiple bills focus on limiting foreign influence in education:
- HB173, SB1067, SB2430, HB4195, HB2595, SB1741, SB2821 prohibit accepting gifts or donations from Chinese government entities and other designated countries, with penalties up to 150% of contract/donation value
- HB1450 mandates detailed quarterly reporting of all foreign funding sources
- HB4762, SB1273, SB2430, and SB1741 establish increased security measures targeting foreign research activities, requiring extensive background checks for Chinese researchers
- HB3741 requires non-US citizen students and employees to sign declarations that they are not agents of foreign adversaries
- SB2683 prohibits support for student organizations receiving funding from Chinese entities, directly impacting Chinese Student and Scholar Associations
- SB762 restricts flag displays in schools, potentially limiting expression of Chinese cultural identity

The bills also introduce curriculum and administrative changes:
- HB1457 and SB453 mandate courses covering sensitive topics in Chinese history including Tiananmen Square, Tibet, and Uyghurs
- HB3564 requires detailed demographic data collection specifically identifying Chinese students

Additional measures include:
- SB1319 caps foreign student athletic scholarships at 25% of total available scholarships
- SB2430 requires monitoring of international travel and restricts academic partnerships

The collective impact of these bills creates a hostile environment for Chinese students, scholars, and immigrants in Texas educational institutions, potentially limiting educational access, research opportunities, and cultural expression while increasing surveillance, administrative barriers, and potential discrimination.


### Translation

教育法案通常关注课程标准、资金分配和学生资格标准。然而，这些德克萨斯州法案显示出一系列针对国际学生和外国学术联系的限制性措施，特别影响中国移民和学生。

多项法案(HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324, HB371, HB4707, HB4886, HB5371)系统性地限制未获授权的移民获得州内学费待遇或接受公共教育。学校必须收取非居民学费，报告无证学生，并可能拒绝录取。这些变化显著影响没有适当文件的中国学生，大幅增加他们的教育成本或完全阻止他们接受教育。

多项法案致力于限制外国在教育领域的影响：
- HB173, SB1067, SB2430, HB4195, HB2595, SB1741和SB2821禁止接受来自中国政府实体和其他指定国家的礼物或捐赠，违规将被处以高达合同/捐赠价值150%的罚款
- HB1450要求详细季度报告所有外国资金来源
- HB4762, SB1273, SB2430和SB1741建立针对外国研究活动的加强安全措施，要求对中国研究人员进行广泛的背景调查
- HB3741要求非美国公民学生和员工签署声明，表明他们不是外国对手的代理人
- SB2683禁止支持接受中国实体资助的学生组织，直接影响中国学生学者联谊会
- SB762限制学校展示旗帜，可能限制中国文化身份的表达

这些法案还引入课程和行政变更：
- HB1457和SB453强制要求课程涵盖中国历史敏感话题，包括天安门广场、西藏和维吾尔族
- HB3564要求专门识别中国学生的详细人口统计数据收集

其他措施包括：
- SB1319将外国学生运动奖学金限制在总可用奖学金的25%
- SB2430要求监控国际旅行并限制学术合作

这些法案的综合影响在德克萨斯州教育机构中为中国学生、学者和移民创造了一个敌对环境，可能限制教育机会、研究机会和文化表达，同时增加监视、行政障碍和潜在的歧视。

## Immigration

### Overview

Immigration laws typically focus on regulating the entry, residence, and rights of non-citizens within a jurisdiction. The six Texas bills presented here introduce various measures affecting immigrants, including those from China, ranging from employment verification to child placement regulations.

Key impacts of these bills include:

- Employment Restrictions: HB3681 maintains strict employment verification requirements by mandating all Texas employers to use E-verify for new hires. For Chinese workers, this creates additional scrutiny during hiring, with employers required to report unverified cases to authorities within 5 days, potentially leading to increased ICE involvement.

- Financial Burden: HB4364 continues to impose a 5% fee on international money transfers, directly affecting Chinese residents sending remittances to family in China, creating additional financial strain while funding border security measures.

- Citizenship Restrictions: HB4771 maintains its significant challenge to birthright citizenship, denying US citizenship to Texas-born children unless at least one parent is a US citizen, national, or legal permanent resident. This particularly impacts Chinese immigrants on temporary visas.

- Healthcare Impact: HB2587 requires reporting on uncompensated hospital care costs, potentially affecting healthcare access for uninsured or underinsured Chinese immigrants.

- Child Placement Regulations: HB141 establishes interstate procedures for adoption and foster care placement, affecting international adoptions including those involving Chinese children.

- Protection Against Foreign Interference: SB1349 introduces new offenses for transnational repression and unauthorized foreign law enforcement. While aimed at foreign government agents, this could particularly affect Chinese nationals given China's known transnational activities, potentially creating additional scrutiny for Chinese immigrants.

These bills collectively create a more restrictive environment for immigrants, with particular implications for Chinese nationals through increased monitoring, financial burdens, and limitations on rights and services.



### Translation

移民法通常侧重于规范非公民在管辖区内的入境、居留和权利。这六项德克萨斯州法案提出了各种影响移民（包括中国移民）的措施，涉及从就业验证到儿童安置等多个方面。

这些法案的主要影响包括：

- 就业限制：HB3681维持严格的就业验证要求，强制所有德克萨斯州雇主对新员工使用E-verify系统。对中国工人来说，这在招聘过程中造成额外审查，雇主必须在5天内向当局报告未验证的案例，可能导致移民执法部门的介入增加。

- 经济负担：HB4364继续对国际汇款征收5%的费用，直接影响向中国家人汇款的在美中国居民，在资助边境安全措施的同时增加了经济压力。

- 公民身份限制：HB4771维持对出生公民权的重大挑战，除非父母一方是美国公民、国民或合法永久居民，否则否认在德克萨斯州出生的儿童的美国公民身份。这特别影响持临时签证的中国移民。

- 医疗保健影响：HB2587要求报告未补偿的医院护理成本，可能影响未投保或保险不足的中国移民获得医疗服务。

- 儿童安置规定：HB141建立州际收养和寄养安置程序，影响包括中国儿童在内的国际收养。

- 防止外国干预：SB1349针对跨国压制和未经授权的外国法律执行引入新的犯罪行为。虽然针对外国政府代理人，但考虑到中国已知的跨国活动，这可能特别影响中国公民，potentially对中国移民造成额外审查。

这些法案共同营造了一个对移民更具限制性的环境，通过加强监管、增加经济负担和限制权利与服务，对中国公民产生特殊影响。

### Overview

These bills represent various legislative efforts in Texas focusing on state sovereignty, security, foreign influence, and regulatory measures. While not exclusively targeting Chinese immigrants or nationals, many bills could have significant implications for the Chinese community in Texas.

State Sovereignty and Federal Oversight:
- Multiple bills (HB898, SB80) propose the Texas Sovereignty Act, establishing a committee to review federal actions. This could potentially impact Chinese immigrants if Texas challenges federal immigration policies.

Security and Foreign Relations:
- Several bills focus on China-related security concerns:
  * Multiple bills (SB1348, SB2312) establish committees to monitor Pacific conflicts and investigate threats from foreign adversaries
  * HB4711 expands confidentiality protections in cases involving foreign adversaries
  * Bills addressing transnational repression (HB4616) protect Chinese nationals facing pressure from Chinese government
  * HB127 enhances penalties for trade secret theft benefiting foreign agents
  * HB1170 mandates transportation security threat analysis
  * HB2912 prohibits lobbying for foreign adversaries, directly affecting Chinese government-affiliated individuals

Financial and Regulatory Measures:
- HB1049 establishes a gold/silver currency system with potential restrictions on transactions with certain foreign countries
- HB1451 requires foreign agent registration disclosure for lobbyists
- HB2241 specifically restricts certain Chinese-manufactured firearms
- HB4180 imposes a significant 25% tax on international money transfers, severely impacting Chinese immigrants sending money home

Healthcare and Data Collection:
- HB5242 requires detailed demographic data collection from public benefits recipients, including Chinese ethnicity

These bills collectively indicate an increasing focus on potential security threats and foreign influence, which could lead to enhanced scrutiny and challenges for Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans in Texas. The legislation could create barriers for Chinese nationals in professional settings, limit their financial activities, and potentially subject them to increased surveillance and reporting requirements.


### Translation

这些法案代表德克萨斯州在州主权、安全、外国影响力和监管措施方面的各种立法努力。虽然这些法案并非专门针对中国移民或国民，但许多法案可能会对德克萨斯州的中国社区产生重大影响。

州主权和联邦监督：
- 多项法案（HB898、SB80）提出《德克萨斯主权法案》，设立委员会审查联邦行动。如果德克萨斯州对联邦移民政策提出质疑，这可能会影响中国移民。

安全和外交关系：
- 多项法案关注与中国相关的安全问题：
  * 多项法案（SB1348、SB2312）设立委员会监督太平洋冲突和调查外国威胁
  * HB4711扩大涉及外国对手案件的保密保护
  * 处理跨国压制的法案（HB4616）保护面临中国政府压力的中国公民
  * HB127加重为外国特工窃取商业机密的处罚
  * HB1170要求进行运输安全威胁分析
  * HB2912禁止为外国对手进行游说，直接影响与中国政府有关的个人

金融和监管措施：
- HB1049建立黄金/白银货币系统，可能限制与某些外国的交易
- HB1451要求游说者披露外国特工注册信息
- HB2241具体限制某些中国制造的枪支
- HB4180对国际汇款征收25%的重税，严重影响中国移民向国内汇款

医疗保健和数据收集：
- HB5242要求从公共福利接受者那里收集详细的人口统计数据，包括中国族裔

这些法案共同表明，德克萨斯州越来越关注潜在的安全威胁和外国影响力，这可能导致对德克萨斯州的中国移民和美籍华人加强审查和带来挑战。这些立法可能会给中国公民在专业领域设置障碍，限制他们的金融活动，并可能使他们受到更多的监视和报告要求。
