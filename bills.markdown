## Alien land laws

### Overview

Alien land laws historically have been discriminatory measures used to restrict property ownership rights of specific ethnic or national groups. This comprehensive set of Texas bills represents a modern iteration of such discriminatory legislation, primarily targeting Chinese nationals and entities, along with some other designated countries.

These bills create an extensive framework of restrictions that significantly impact Chinese individuals and entities in Texas:

Property Purchase Restrictions:
- Multiple bills (HB17, HB191, HB402, HB1566, HB1849, HB2389, HB2536, HB2752, HB4296, HB4597, HB4606, SB17, SB103, SB307) explicitly prohibit Chinese nationals, government entities, and Chinese-controlled organizations from purchasing real property in Texas.
- Agricultural land faces particular scrutiny, with HB518, HB1743, SB1063 specifically restricting foreign ownership of farmland, with SB1063 specifically addressing land up to 5 acres.
- New bills HB4597 and HB4606 add restrictions on property within 25 miles of critical infrastructure, commercial property, and multi-family housing.

Enforcement and Penalties:
- HB243 authorizes property seizure through eminent domain near critical infrastructure.
- HB733 requires citizenship verification for residential property purchases.
- Bills like HB1849 impose severe penalties, including criminal charges and fines.
- New homeland security review committees (HB4597, HB4606) will approve/disapprove transactions.

Additional Restrictions and Deadlines:
- HB546 affects tax benefits for foreign-owned open-space land.
- HB2034 restricts groundwater permits for entities from designated countries.
- HB2628 requires existing foreign-owned properties to be divested by March 1, 2026.
- HB1743 forces non-resident Chinese citizens to divest their property by 2027.
- HB2389 and SB103 additionally prohibit Chinese entities from entering contracts with Texas government entities.
- Properties owned before September 2025 are generally grandfathered under newer bills (HB4597, HB4606).

While many bills exempt U.S. citizens and permanent residents of Chinese descent, these laws create a hostile environment for Chinese nationals, students, and temporary workers in Texas. The legislation could affect:
- Chinese students' housing options
- Chinese businesses' operations and government contracts
- Chinese professionals on work visas
- Chinese agricultural investments
- Property values of existing Chinese-owned properties
- Access to groundwater rights
- Tax burden on agricultural and open-space land
- Properties near critical infrastructure

This legislative package represents a discriminatory approach that could lead to broader anti-Chinese sentiment and affect the Chinese-American community, even those exempt from these restrictions.


### Translation

外国人土地法历来是一种歧视性措施，用于限制特定族裔或国籍群体的财产所有权。德克萨斯州的这一系列法案代表了此类歧视性立法的现代版本，主要针对中国公民和实体，以及其他一些指定国家。

这些法案建立了一个广泛的限制框架，显著影响在德克萨斯州的中国个人和实体：

财产购买限制：
- 多项法案(HB17, HB191, HB402, HB1566, HB1849, HB2389, HB2536, HB2752, HB4296, HB4597, HB4606, SB17, SB103, SB307)明确禁止中国公民、政府实体和中国控制的组织在德克萨斯州购买不动产。
- 农业用地受到特别审查，HB518、HB1743、SB1063特别限制外国人拥有农田，其中SB1063具体针对5英亩以下的土地。
- 新法案HB4597和HB4606增加了对关键基础设施25英里范围内的房产、商业地产和多户住宅的限制。

执法和处罚：
- HB243授权通过征用权没收靠近关键基础设施的财产。
- HB733要求验证购买住宅物业的公民身份。
- 如HB1849等法案施加严厉处罚，包括刑事指控和罚款。
- 新设立的国土安全审查委员会(HB4597, HB4606)将负责批准/否决交易。

额外限制和期限：
- HB546影响外国人拥有的开放空间土地的税收优惠。
- HB2034限制指定国家实体的地下水许可。
- HB2628要求现有外国人拥有的房产在2026年3月1日前出售。
- HB1743强制非居民中国公民在2027年前出售其房产。
- HB2389和SB103还禁止中国实体与德克萨斯州政府实体签订合同。
- 在2025年9月前拥有的房产通常在新法案(HB4597, HB4606)下可以保留。

虽然许多法案豁免了具有中国血统的美国公民和永久居民，但这些法律为中国公民、学生和临时工作者创造了一个敌对环境。这些立法可能影响：
- 中国学生的住房选择
- 中国企业的运营和政府合同
- 持工作签证的中国专业人士
- 中国农业投资
- 现有中国人拥有房产的价值
- 地下水权获取
- 农业和开放空间土地的税收负担
- 靠近关键基础设施的房产

这套立法方案代表了一种歧视性做法，可能导致更广泛的反华情绪，并影响中美社区，即使是那些被豁免的人群。

### Talking Points Against SB17
**SB 17 is un-American and anti-Texan.  Let’s keep Texas open for business.** 

1. **Harm to Texas Economy & Reputation**

    * **Disruption to Real Estate Markets**: Banning property ownership by foreign individuals and companies would destabilize real estate transactions across commercial, industrial, residential, and agricultural markets.  
    
    * **Excessive Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Compliance with SB 17 would introduce unnecessary red tape, leading to delays, increased transaction costs, and making Texas a less attractive place for investment and growth.  
    
    * **Impact on Major Trading Partners**: Texas' key trading partners—responsible for tens of billions in annual trade—would face unnecessary restrictions, diminishing international business and economic relationships. (Mainland China is Texas’ 3rd largest trading partner, which imported $26.467 billion from Texas in 2024\.)  
    
    * **Risk of Job Losses and Economic Setback**: Restricting property purchases would create a hostile environment for investors and entrepreneurs, prompting them to choose or relocate to more welcoming states, which could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth. This runs counter to Texas' ongoing efforts to stimulate economic development.  
    
    * **Discouraging Skilled Foreign Talent**: SB 17 would discourage high-skilled foreign talent from coming to Texas, weakening the state's competitive edge in technology, manufacturing and other sectors.  
    
    * **Hurting Existing Texas Businesses**: Many existing Texas businesses would like to bring their upstream supply chains and reshore manufacturing to Texas to make them more competitive.  Texas could become a manufacturing powerhouse.  However, SB 17 runs counter to such efforts, hurting existing Texas businesses and making Texas less attractive for corporate relocation.    
    
    * **Damage to Texas’ Pro-Business Reputation**: This bill threatens Texas’ image as a pro-business hub, potentially pushing businesses to relocate to states with a more favorable climate for investment and innovation.  
    
    * **Texas' Legacy at Stake**: Texas should continue to champion its legacy as a leader in innovation, commerce, and economic prosperity, not impose unnecessary, harmful restrictions. We must protect the state’s “Open for Business” reputation.  
    
2. **SB 17 Will Not Achieve Its Stated Goals**  
     
    * The bill claims to “protect key land and natural resources from hostile counties and their actors” and to ensure national security.  However, there is no clear evidence to support that restricting property ownership will achieve these objectives.  
    
3. **Unclear Definitions and Practical Challenges**  
     
    * **Overly Broad Definition of Agricultural Land**: The bill defines “agricultural land” too broadly, leaving it unclear who will determine whether property is “suitable” for plant production or animal farming.  Many Texans grow their own fruits or raise animals on their properties for personal use, yet the broad definition could subject such properties to SB 17’s restrictions.  Additionally, properties leased for agricultural or farming purposes to gain agricultural tax exemptions but are otherwise located in the urban areas could be negatively impacted.  
    
    * **Expansion of Property Restrictions**: SB 17 now includes *commercial, industrial, and residential properties* under its restrictions, expanding beyond the provisions of SB 147 from 2023\.  However, there’s no evidence suggesting foreign ownership of these properties poses a national security threat.  The bill’s scope is overly broad and doesn’t align with its stated objectives.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around the Leasehold Exception**: The leasehold exception is confusing.  It is unclear what “improvements constructed on a leasehold” means.  
    
    * **Vague Definitions of “Risk”**: The bill includes terms such as “corporate espionage” and “public nuisance” under the definition of “risk to public health, safety, and welfare.”  How these will be determined is unclear, leaving too much room for interpretation and creating uncertainty.  An objective, justifiable test for “risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public” would be needed.   
    
    * **Nonsensical Provisions on “Bodily Injury”**: The bill also includes restrictions based on bodily injury, including introducing a dangerous disease or substance into an area.  This could lead to absurd situations where property owners are forced to sell their property due to minor incidents like a slip and fall or the common flu—undermining legal fairness.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around Domicile**: The bill restricts property ownership for individuals "domiciled" in certain countries but fails to define “domicile,” creating confusion.  Under Texas law, domicile is typically based on physical presence and intent to stay permanently, yet federal immigration laws prevent certain visa holders (e.g., H-1B employment visa, F-1 student visa) from establishing domicile in the U.S.  It could take over ten years for a Chinese national with an H1-B employment visa to become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.  The bill makes the bill overly broad and unnecessarily burdensome for lawful residents working in and contributing to Texas economy.    
    
    * **Unaddressed Practical Issues**: Issues like inheritance, foreclosure, and foreign nationals’ collateral property ownership are not adequately addressed, which could lead to significant financial and legal complications.  
    
    * **Harsh Consequences for Violations**: The bill’s “forced sale” provision for violations is overly punitive, risking devastating financial losses and legal disputes.  
    
    * **Lack of Certainty**: The bill’s ambiguity and lack of pre-clearance mechanisms for transactions could deter foreign investments and talent from choosing Texas as their home or business location.  
    
    * **Lack of Protection for Service Providers**: The bill does not provide protection for title companies, real estate agents, attorneys and other service providers involved in real estate transactions.  This would create a chilling effect on these service providers.

4. **Violates Federal Preemption and the Constitution**

    * **Federal Oversight of Foreign Purchases**: The federal government already regulates foreign property transactions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), making Texas’ attempt to impose additional restrictions unconstitutional and legally void.  
    
    * **Legal Enforceability Issues**: Federal preemption prevents states from enacting conflicting or supplementary laws in areas already federally regulated, rendering SB 17 legally unenforceable.  
    
5. **Unjustified Association Between Individuals and Governments**  
     
    * **Punishing Individuals for Their Governments' Actions**: The bill unfairly targets individuals based on their home country’s government actions, contradicting American values of individual responsibility and equal protection under the law. Those individuals and businesses make the choice to call Texas home.   
    
    * **Dangerous Precedents**: This mirrors historical injustices such as Japanese internment during WWII, setting a dangerous precedent for racial and ethnic discrimination.  
    
6. **Likely Legal Violations**

    SB 17 discriminates based on national origin, violating several federal and state laws, including:

    * 14th Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)  
    
    * Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 3a (Prohibits discrimination based on national origin)  
    
    * Fair Housing Act (Prohibits housing discrimination)  
    
    * WTO Agreements (Potential violation of international trade laws)  
    
7. **Broader Discriminatory and Social Implications**

    * **Fostering Xenophobia**: By targeting specific nationalities, the bill fosters racial profiling, increasing discrimination against all Asian Americans—not just Chinese Americans—due to perceived ethnic similarity. This could lead to negative economic and social consequences for the AAPI community in Texas, including those born in Texas and U.S. citizens.  
    
    * **Dividing Communities**: The bill unjustly equates lawful immigrants with national security threats, creating an environment of fear, suspicion, and division among Texans.   
    
8. **Lessons from History**

    * **Repeating Past Mistakes**: Texas had alien land laws back in the 19-20th century restricting foreign land ownership but the state legislature abolished them in 1965 “on the grounds that they imposed **unreasonable and discriminatory restrictions** on alien ownership and militated against efforts by the state to entice foreign investment and stimulate economic development and industrial growth.”  Enacting SB 17 would repeat past mistakes and undo decades of progress, reversing Texas’ global standing and economic growth.  
    
    * **Learning from the Past**: Texas must learn from its own history and reject SB 17 to maintain its legacy as a beacon of opportunity, economic strength, and global leadership.  Keep Texas open for business\! 

## Education

### Overview

Education bills typically focus on curriculum standards, funding allocation, and student eligibility criteria. However, this set of Texas bills reveals a concerning pattern of restrictions targeting international students and foreign academic connections, with particular implications for Chinese immigrants and students.

Several bills (HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324, HB371, HB4707) systematically restrict unauthorized immigrants from qualifying for in-state tuition or accessing public education, requiring reclassification as non-residents and potentially denying admission. These changes significantly impact Chinese students without proper documentation by substantially increasing their education costs or completely barring their access to education.

Multiple bills focus on limiting foreign influence in education:
- HB173, SB1067, SB1741, HB4195, and HB2595 prohibit accepting gifts or donations from Chinese government entities and other designated countries, with penalties up to 150% of contract/donation value
- HB1450 mandates detailed quarterly reporting of all foreign funding sources
- HB4762 and SB1273 establish increased security measures targeting foreign research activities
- HB3741 requires non-US citizen students and employees to sign declarations that they are not agents of foreign adversaries

The bills also introduce curriculum and administrative changes:
- HB1457 and SB453 mandate courses covering sensitive topics in Chinese history including Tiananmen Square, Tibet, and Uyghurs
- SB762 regulates flag displays, though allowing official national flags
- HB3564 requires detailed demographic data collection specifically identifying Chinese students

Additional measures include:
- SB1319 caps foreign student athletic scholarships at 25% of total available scholarships
- SB1741 requires espionage prevention training and suspicious activity reporting systems

The collective impact of these bills creates a hostile environment for Chinese students, scholars, and immigrants in Texas educational institutions, potentially limiting educational access, research opportunities, and cultural expression while increasing surveillance, administrative barriers, and potential discrimination.


### Translation

教育法案通常关注课程标准、资金分配和学生资格标准。然而，这些德克萨斯州法案呈现出一系列针对国际学生和外国学术联系的限制性措施，特别影响中国移民和学生。

多项法案(HB160、HB232、HB424、HB979、HB1324、HB371、HB4707)系统性地限制未获授权的移民获得州内学费待遇或接受公共教育，要求将其重新归类为非居民，并可能拒绝入学。这些变化显著增加了无proper文件的中国学生的教育成本，或完全阻止他们接受教育。

多项法案致力于限制外国影响：
- HB173、SB1067、SB1741、HB4195和HB2595禁止接受来自中国政府实体和其他指定国家的礼物或捐赠，违规将被处以高达合同/捐赠价值150%的罚款
- HB1450要求详细季度报告所有外国资金来源
- HB4762和SB1273建立针对外国研究活动的加强安全措施
- HB3741要求非美国公民学生和员工签署声明，表明他们不是外国对手的代理人

这些法案还引入课程和行政变更：
- HB1457和SB453强制要求课程涵盖中国历史敏感话题，包括天安门广场事件、西藏和维吾尔族
- SB762规范旗帜展示，但允许官方国旗
- HB3564要求收集详细的人口统计数据，特别识别中国学生

其他措施包括：
- SB1319将外国学生运动奖学金限制在总可用奖学金的25%
- SB1741要求间谍预防培训和可疑活动报告系统

这些法案的综合影响为德克萨斯州教育机构中的中国学生、学者和移民创造了一个充满敌意的环境，可能限制教育机会、研究机会和文化表达，同时增加监视、行政障碍和潜在歧视。

## Immigration

### Overview

Immigration laws typically focus on regulating the entry, residence, and rights of non-citizens within a jurisdiction. The five Texas bills presented here introduce restrictive measures that affect unauthorized immigrants, including those from China.

HB1762 creates a more severe criminal justice environment for unauthorized immigrants by eliminating access to community supervision or deferred adjudication options in Texas criminal cases. This particularly impacts Chinese nationals who may have overstayed their visas or entered without proper documentation, forcing them to face full penalties without access to alternative sentencing options.

HB2587 implements a healthcare tracking system that requires hospitals to document and report costs associated with treating unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandates immigration status disclosure during hospital intake, which could create barriers to healthcare access for Chinese immigrants without legal status, potentially deterring them from seeking necessary medical care due to fear of detection.

HB3681 adds strict employment verification requirements by mandating all Texas employers to use E-verify for new hires. For Chinese workers, this creates additional scrutiny during the hiring process, with employers required to report cases where E-verify cannot confirm legal status to authorities within 5 days. This could lead to increased ICE involvement and create significant employment barriers for Chinese immigrants.

HB4364 introduces a new 5% fee on international money transfers, which directly affects Chinese residents in the US who send remittances to family members in China. This additional cost burden could significantly impact Chinese immigrants' ability to support their families back home while contributing to border security funding.

HB4771 represents a significant change to birthright citizenship in Texas, denying US citizenship to children born in Texas unless at least one parent is a US citizen, national, or legal permanent resident. This directly impacts Chinese immigrants without permanent resident status, as their Texas-born children would be denied citizenship, creating potential multi-generational impacts on Chinese immigrant families.

These bills collectively create a hostile environment for unauthorized immigrants, including Chinese nationals, by:
- Removing access to alternative sentencing options
- Creating barriers to healthcare access through mandatory status reporting
- Implementing strict employment verification with swift reporting requirements to authorities
- Imposing financial penalties on international money transfers
- Restricting birthright citizenship for children of non-permanent residents


### Translation

移民法通常侧重于规范非公民在特定管辖区内的入境、居留和权利。这五项德克萨斯州法案引入了针对非法移民（包括来自中国的移民）的限制性措施。

HB1762通过取消非法移民在德克萨斯州刑事案件中获得社区监督或延期判决的机会，创造了更为严厉的刑事司法环境。这特别影响签证逾期或无证入境的中国公民，迫使他们在没有替代判决选项的情况下面临全额处罚。

HB2587实施医疗保健追踪系统，要求医院记录和报告与治疗非法移民相关的费用。该法案要求在医院入院时披露移民身份，这可能会为无合法身份的中国移民获取医疗服务设置障碍，由于担心被发现而阻止他们寻求必要的医疗护理。

HB3681增加了严格的就业验证要求，强制所有德克萨斯州雇主对新雇员使用E-verify系统。对中国工人来说，这在招聘过程中造成额外审查，雇主必须在5天内向当局报告E-verify无法确认合法身份的案例。这可能导致移民执法部门的介入并为中国移民创造重大就业障碍。

HB4364对国际汇款引入5%的费用，这直接影响在美国的中国居民向中国家庭成员汇款。这额外的费用负担可能显著影响中国移民支持其家庭的能力。

HB4771对德克萨斯州的出生公民权做出重大改变，除非父母至少一方是美国公民、国民或合法永久居民，否则在德克萨斯州出生的儿童将不被视为美国公民。这直接影响没有永久居留权的中国移民，他们在德克萨斯州出生的子女将被拒绝公民身份。

这些法案通过以下方式共同为非法移民（包括中国公民）创造了不利环境：
- 取消替代判决选项
- 通过强制报告身份状况设置医疗保健障碍
- 实施严格的就业验证并要求迅速向当局报告
- 对国际汇款征收额外费用
- 限制非永久居民子女的出生公民权

## Others

### Overview

These bills represent various legislative efforts in Texas focusing on state sovereignty, security, foreign influence, energy development, and financial regulations. While not exclusively targeting Chinese immigrants or nationals, several bills could have significant implications for the Chinese community in Texas.

State Sovereignty and Federal Oversight:
- Three bills (HB796, HB898, and SB80) propose the Texas Sovereignty Act, establishing a committee to review federal actions. This could potentially impact Chinese immigrants if Texas challenges federal immigration policies or international agreements with China.

Security and Foreign Relations:
- Two bills (HB118 and SB1348) establish the Texas Advisory Committee on Pacific Conflict, specifically focused on potential conflicts with China, which could lead to increased scrutiny of Chinese-American businesses and individuals
- HB14 establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Deployment Act, potentially affecting Chinese nationals in the nuclear sector through security requirements
- HB1170 mandates transportation security threat analysis, possibly leading to increased surveillance of Chinese travelers
- HB4711 expands confidentiality protections regarding hostile foreign acts, which could impact Chinese individuals given current US-China relations
- Two bills (HB4616 and SB1349) criminalize transnational repression, particularly targeting activities often associated with Chinese government influence operations, potentially affecting Chinese nationals who might be falsely suspected of such activities

Financial and Regulatory Measures:
- HB1056 establishes a gold/silver currency system, with potential restrictions on transactions with certain foreign countries
- HB1451 requires foreign agent registration disclosure for lobbyists, affecting Chinese individuals or organizations engaged in lobbying
- HB2241 specifically restricts certain Chinese-manufactured firearms, including specific models like AK47 and AKS
- HB4180 imposes a significant 25% tax on international money transfers, which would heavily impact Chinese immigrants sending money to family in China

These bills collectively indicate an increasing focus on potential security threats and foreign influence, which could lead to enhanced scrutiny and challenges for Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans in Texas, particularly in areas of nuclear energy, transportation, business operations, and financial transactions.

这些法案代表德克萨斯州在州主权、安全、外国影响、能源发展和金融监管方面的各种立法努力。虽然这些法案并非专门针对中国移民或国民，但其中几项法案可能会对德克萨斯州的中国社区产生重大影响。

州主权和联邦监督：
- 三项法案（HB796、HB898和SB80）提出《德克萨斯主权法案》，设立委员会审查联邦行动。如果德克萨斯州对联邦移民政策或与中国的国际协议提出质疑，这可能会影响中国移民。

安全和外交关系：
- 两项法案（HB118和SB1348）设立德克萨斯太平洋冲突咨询委员会，专门关注与中国的潜在冲突，可能导致对中美企业和个人的审查加强
- HB14建立德克萨斯先进核能部署法案，可能通过安全要求影响核能领域的中国公民
- HB1170要求进行运输安全威胁分析，可能导致对中国旅客加强监控
- HB4711扩大了针对敌对外国行为的保密保护，鉴于当前美中关系，可能影响中国个人
- 两项法案（HB4616和SB1349）将跨国压制定为刑事犯罪，特别针对常与中国政府影响力行动相关的活动，可能影响被错误怀疑参与此类活动的中国公民

金融和监管措施：
- HB1056建立金/银货币体系，可能限制与某些外国的交易
- HB1451要求游说者披露外国代理人登记信息，影响从事游说活动的中国个人或组织
- HB2241特别限制某些中国制造的枪支，包括AK47和AKS等特定型号
- HB4180对国际汇款征收25%的重税，这将严重影响向中国家人汇款的中国移民

这些法案共同表明，德克萨斯州越来越关注潜在的安全威胁和外国影响，这可能会导致对德克萨斯州的中国移民和美籍华人在核能、运输、商业运营和金融交易等领域面临更严格的审查和挑战。
