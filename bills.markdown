Below, we provide categorized updates to help you stay informed. Each category includes an overview analyzing the potential impact of new bills, followed by a comprehensive list of proposed legislation.

Every bill is accompanied by an AI-generated summary, along with translations to ensure accessibility for affected immigrant communities. Additionally, the AI suggests potential legislative committees where these bills may be assigned. To ensure accuracy and reliability, we collaborate closely with legislative experts to review and validate these summaries. Updates will be made as new information becomes available.

## Alien land laws

### Overview

Alien land laws historically have been discriminatory measures used to restrict property ownership rights of specific ethnic or national groups. This set of Texas bills represents a modern iteration of such discriminatory legislation, primarily targeting Chinese nationals and entities, along with some other designated countries.

These bills create a comprehensive framework of restrictions that significantly impact Chinese individuals and entities in Texas:

Property Purchase Restrictions:
- Multiple bills (HB191, HB402, HB1566, HB1849, HB2389, HB2536, HB2752, SB17, SB103, SB307) explicitly prohibit Chinese nationals, government entities, and Chinese-controlled organizations from purchasing real property in Texas.
- Agricultural land faces particular scrutiny, with HB518, HB1743, SB1063 specifically restricting foreign ownership of farmland, with SB1063 specifically addressing land up to 5 acres.

Enforcement and Penalties:
- HB243 authorizes property seizure through eminent domain near critical infrastructure.
- HB733 requires citizenship verification for residential property purchases.
- Bills like HB1849 impose severe penalties, including criminal charges and fines.

Additional Restrictions:
- HB546 affects tax benefits for foreign-owned open-space land.
- HB2034 restricts groundwater permits for entities from designated countries.
- HB2628 requires existing foreign-owned properties to be divested by March 1, 2026.
- HB1743 forces non-resident Chinese citizens to divest their property by 2027.
- HB2389 and SB103 additionally prohibit Chinese entities from entering contracts with Texas government entities.

While many bills exempt U.S. citizens and permanent residents of Chinese descent, these laws create a hostile environment for Chinese nationals, students, and temporary workers in Texas. The legislation could affect:
- Chinese students' housing options
- Chinese businesses' operations and government contracts
- Chinese professionals on work visas
- Chinese agricultural investments
- Property values of existing Chinese-owned properties
- Access to groundwater rights
- Tax burden on agricultural and open-space land

This legislative package represents a discriminatory approach that could lead to broader anti-Chinese sentiment and affect the Chinese-American community, even those exempt from these restrictions.


### Translation

外国人土地法历来是一种歧视性措施，用于限制特定种族或国籍群体的财产所有权。这套德克萨斯州法案代表了此类歧视性立法的现代版本，主要针对中国公民和实体，以及其他一些指定国家。

这些法案创建了一个全面的限制框架，严重影响在德克萨斯州的中国个人和实体：

房地产购买限制：
- 多项法案（HB191、HB402、HB1566、HB1849、HB2389、HB2536、HB2752、SB17、SB103、SB307）明确禁止中国公民、政府实体和中国控制的组织在德克萨斯州购买房地产。
- 农业用地受到特别审查，HB518、HB1743、SB1063专门限制外国人拥有农田，其中SB1063特别针对5英亩以下的土地。

执法和处罚：
- HB243授权通过征用权没收关键基础设施附近的房产。
- HB733要求验证购买住宅房产者的公民身份。
- 如HB1849等法案规定严厉处罚，包括刑事指控和罚款。

额外限制：
- HB546影响外国人拥有的开放空间土地的税收优惠。
- HB2034限制指定国家实体的地下水许可。
- HB2628要求现有外国人拥有的房产在2026年3月1日前出售。
- HB1743强制非居民中国公民在2027年前出售其房产。
- HB2389和SB103还禁止中国实体与德克萨斯州政府实体签订合同。

虽然许多法案豁免了具有中国血统的美国公民和永久居民，但这些法律为在德克萨斯州的中国公民、学生和临时工作者创造了一个敌对环境。这些立法可能影响：
- 中国学生的住房选择
- 中国企业的运营和政府合同
- 持工作签证的中国专业人士
- 中国在农业领域的投资
- 现有中国人拥有房产的价值
- 地下水权限的获取
- 农业和开放空间土地的税收负担

这套立法方案代表了一种歧视性做法，可能导致更广泛的反华情绪，并影响中美社区，即使是那些被豁免的人群也可能受到影响。

### Talking Points Against SB17
**SB 17 is un-American and anti-Texan.  Let’s keep Texas open for business.** 

1. **Harm to Texas Economy & Reputation**

    * **Disruption to Real Estate Markets**: Banning property ownership by foreign individuals and companies would destabilize real estate transactions across commercial, industrial, residential, and agricultural markets.  
    
    * **Excessive Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Compliance with SB 17 would introduce unnecessary red tape, leading to delays, increased transaction costs, and making Texas a less attractive place for investment and growth.  
    
    * **Impact on Major Trading Partners**: Texas' key trading partners—responsible for tens of billions in annual trade—would face unnecessary restrictions, diminishing international business and economic relationships. (Mainland China is Texas’ 3rd largest trading partner, which imported $26.467 billion from Texas in 2024\.)  
    
    * **Risk of Job Losses and Economic Setback**: Restricting property purchases would create a hostile environment for investors and entrepreneurs, prompting them to choose or relocate to more welcoming states, which could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth. This runs counter to Texas' ongoing efforts to stimulate economic development.  
    
    * **Discouraging Skilled Foreign Talent**: SB 17 would discourage high-skilled foreign talent from coming to Texas, weakening the state's competitive edge in technology, manufacturing and other sectors.  
    
    * **Hurting Existing Texas Businesses**: Many existing Texas businesses would like to bring their upstream supply chains and reshore manufacturing to Texas to make them more competitive.  Texas could become a manufacturing powerhouse.  However, SB 17 runs counter to such efforts, hurting existing Texas businesses and making Texas less attractive for corporate relocation.    
    
    * **Damage to Texas’ Pro-Business Reputation**: This bill threatens Texas’ image as a pro-business hub, potentially pushing businesses to relocate to states with a more favorable climate for investment and innovation.  
    
    * **Texas' Legacy at Stake**: Texas should continue to champion its legacy as a leader in innovation, commerce, and economic prosperity, not impose unnecessary, harmful restrictions. We must protect the state’s “Open for Business” reputation.  
    
2. **SB 17 Will Not Achieve Its Stated Goals**  
     
    * The bill claims to “protect key land and natural resources from hostile counties and their actors” and to ensure national security.  However, there is no clear evidence to support that restricting property ownership will achieve these objectives.  
    
3. **Unclear Definitions and Practical Challenges**  
     
    * **Overly Broad Definition of Agricultural Land**: The bill defines “agricultural land” too broadly, leaving it unclear who will determine whether property is “suitable” for plant production or animal farming.  Many Texans grow their own fruits or raise animals on their properties for personal use, yet the broad definition could subject such properties to SB 17’s restrictions.  Additionally, properties leased for agricultural or farming purposes to gain agricultural tax exemptions but are otherwise located in the urban areas could be negatively impacted.  
    
    * **Expansion of Property Restrictions**: SB 17 now includes *commercial, industrial, and residential properties* under its restrictions, expanding beyond the provisions of SB 147 from 2023\.  However, there’s no evidence suggesting foreign ownership of these properties poses a national security threat.  The bill’s scope is overly broad and doesn’t align with its stated objectives.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around the Leasehold Exception**: The leasehold exception is confusing.  It is unclear what “improvements constructed on a leasehold” means.  
    
    * **Vague Definitions of “Risk”**: The bill includes terms such as “corporate espionage” and “public nuisance” under the definition of “risk to public health, safety, and welfare.”  How these will be determined is unclear, leaving too much room for interpretation and creating uncertainty.  An objective, justifiable test for “risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public” would be needed.   
    
    * **Nonsensical Provisions on “Bodily Injury”**: The bill also includes restrictions based on bodily injury, including introducing a dangerous disease or substance into an area.  This could lead to absurd situations where property owners are forced to sell their property due to minor incidents like a slip and fall or the common flu—undermining legal fairness.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around Domicile**: The bill restricts property ownership for individuals "domiciled" in certain countries but fails to define “domicile,” creating confusion.  Under Texas law, domicile is typically based on physical presence and intent to stay permanently, yet federal immigration laws prevent certain visa holders (e.g., H-1B employment visa, F-1 student visa) from establishing domicile in the U.S.  It could take over ten years for a Chinese national with an H1-B employment visa to become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.  The bill makes the bill overly broad and unnecessarily burdensome for lawful residents working in and contributing to Texas economy.    
    
    * **Unaddressed Practical Issues**: Issues like inheritance, foreclosure, and foreign nationals’ collateral property ownership are not adequately addressed, which could lead to significant financial and legal complications.  
    
    * **Harsh Consequences for Violations**: The bill’s “forced sale” provision for violations is overly punitive, risking devastating financial losses and legal disputes.  
    
    * **Lack of Certainty**: The bill’s ambiguity and lack of pre-clearance mechanisms for transactions could deter foreign investments and talent from choosing Texas as their home or business location.  
    
    * **Lack of Protection for Service Providers**: The bill does not provide protection for title companies, real estate agents, attorneys and other service providers involved in real estate transactions.  This would create a chilling effect on these service providers.

4. **Violates Federal Preemption and the Constitution**

    * **Federal Oversight of Foreign Purchases**: The federal government already regulates foreign property transactions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), making Texas’ attempt to impose additional restrictions unconstitutional and legally void.  
    
    * **Legal Enforceability Issues**: Federal preemption prevents states from enacting conflicting or supplementary laws in areas already federally regulated, rendering SB 17 legally unenforceable.  
    
5. **Unjustified Association Between Individuals and Governments**  
     
    * **Punishing Individuals for Their Governments' Actions**: The bill unfairly targets individuals based on their home country’s government actions, contradicting American values of individual responsibility and equal protection under the law. Those individuals and businesses make the choice to call Texas home.   
    
    * **Dangerous Precedents**: This mirrors historical injustices such as Japanese internment during WWII, setting a dangerous precedent for racial and ethnic discrimination.  
    
6. **Likely Legal Violations**

    SB 17 discriminates based on national origin, violating several federal and state laws, including:

    * 14th Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)  
    
    * Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 3a (Prohibits discrimination based on national origin)  
    
    * Fair Housing Act (Prohibits housing discrimination)  
    
    * WTO Agreements (Potential violation of international trade laws)  
    
7. **Broader Discriminatory and Social Implications**

    * **Fostering Xenophobia**: By targeting specific nationalities, the bill fosters racial profiling, increasing discrimination against all Asian Americans—not just Chinese Americans—due to perceived ethnic similarity. This could lead to negative economic and social consequences for the AAPI community in Texas, including those born in Texas and U.S. citizens.  
    
    * **Dividing Communities**: The bill unjustly equates lawful immigrants with national security threats, creating an environment of fear, suspicion, and division among Texans.   
    
8. **Lessons from History**

    * **Repeating Past Mistakes**: Texas had alien land laws back in the 19-20th century restricting foreign land ownership but the state legislature abolished them in 1965 “on the grounds that they imposed **unreasonable and discriminatory restrictions** on alien ownership and militated against efforts by the state to entice foreign investment and stimulate economic development and industrial growth.”  Enacting SB 17 would repeat past mistakes and undo decades of progress, reversing Texas’ global standing and economic growth.  
    
    * **Learning from the Past**: Texas must learn from its own history and reject SB 17 to maintain its legacy as a beacon of opportunity, economic strength, and global leadership.  Keep Texas open for business\! 

## Education

### Overview

Education bills typically focus on curriculum standards, funding allocation, and student eligibility criteria. However, this set of Texas bills reveals a concerning pattern of restrictions targeting international students and foreign academic connections, with particular implications for Chinese immigrants and students.

Several bills (HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324) systematically restrict unauthorized immigrants from qualifying for in-state tuition, requiring reclassification as non-residents. These changes significantly impact Chinese students without proper documentation by substantially increasing their education costs. HB371 further restricts public school access for undocumented students unless federal funding is secured.

Multiple bills focus on limiting foreign influence in education:
- HB173, SB1067, and SB1741 prohibit accepting gifts or donations from Chinese government entities and other designated countries
- HB1450 mandates detailed quarterly reporting of all foreign funding sources
- HB2595 broadly restricts educational partnerships with "foreign adversaries," including China, with substantial penalties
- SB1273 and SB1741 establish increased security measures targeting foreign research activities, implementing heightened scrutiny of Chinese researchers through background checks and suspicious activity reporting systems

The bills also introduce curriculum changes through HB1457 and SB453, mandating courses covering sensitive topics in Chinese history including Tiananmen Square, Tibet, and Uyghurs, which could potentially shape public perception of Chinese immigrants and their communities.

Additional restrictions include:
- SB1319 caps foreign student athletic scholarships at 25% of total available scholarships
- SB762 regulates flag displays, though allowing official national flags
- SB1273 increases surveillance and background checks for Chinese researchers

The collective impact of these bills creates a challenging environment for Chinese students, scholars, and immigrants in Texas educational institutions, potentially limiting educational access, research opportunities, and cultural expression while increasing surveillance and administrative barriers.


### Translation

教育法案通常关注课程标准、资金分配和学生资格标准。然而，这些德克萨斯州法案呈现出一系列针对国际学生和外国学术联系的限制性措施，特别影响中国移民和学生。

多项法案(HB160、HB232、HB424、HB979、HB1324)系统性地限制未获授权的移民获得州内学费资格，要求将其重新归类为非居民。这些变化显著增加了无proper文件的中国学生的教育成本。HB371进一步限制了无证学生接受公立教育的机会，除非获得联邦资金支持。

多项法案致力于限制外国在教育领域的影响：
- HB173、SB1067和SB1741禁止接受来自中国政府实体和其他指定国家的捐赠
- HB1450要求详细季度报告所有外国资金来源
- HB2595广泛限制与"外国对手"（包括中国）的教育合作，并设有重大处罚
- SB1273和SB1741建立了加强的安全措施，通过背景调查和可疑活动报告系统，加强对中国研究人员的审查

HB1457和SB453引入课程变更，要求必修包括天安门广场事件、西藏和维吾尔等敏感中国历史话题的课程，这可能影响公众对中国移民及其社区的看法。

其他限制包括：
- SB1319将外国学生运动奖学金限制在总奖学金的25%
- SB762规范旗帜展示，但允许官方国旗
- SB1273加强对中国研究人员的监督和背景调查

这些法案的综合影响为德克萨斯州教育机构中的中国学生、学者和移民创造了一个充满挑战的环境，可能限制教育机会、研究机会和文化表达，同时增加监督和行政障碍。

7. Legal Proceedings (HB2884, SB1200):

## Immigration

### Overview

Immigration laws typically focus on regulating the entry, residence, and rights of non-citizens within a jurisdiction. The two Texas bills presented here introduce restrictive measures that affect unauthorized immigrants, including those from China.

HB1762 creates a more severe criminal justice environment for unauthorized immigrants by eliminating access to community supervision or deferred adjudication options in Texas criminal cases. This particularly impacts Chinese nationals who may have overstayed their visas or entered without proper documentation, forcing them to face full penalties without access to alternative sentencing options that are available to others. This could result in longer incarceration periods and more severe consequences for even minor offenses.

HB2587 implements a healthcare tracking system that requires hospitals to document and report costs associated with treating unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandates immigration status disclosure during hospital intake, which could create barriers to healthcare access for Chinese immigrants without legal status. This requirement might deter unauthorized Chinese immigrants from seeking necessary medical care due to fear of detection or reporting, potentially leading to serious public health consequences.

Both bills, while not explicitly targeting Chinese immigrants, create additional layers of scrutiny and restrictions that could disproportionately affect Chinese nationals who are out of status, potentially forcing them to live in fear of seeking basic services or legal protections.


### Translation

移民法通常侧重于规范非公民在特定管辖区内的入境、居留和权利。这里提出的两项德克萨斯州法案针对非法移民推出了限制性措施，其中包括来自中国的移民。

HB1762法案通过取消未经授权移民在德克萨斯州刑事案件中获得社区监督或延期判决的机会，造就了一个更为严厉的刑事司法环境。这特别影响到签证逾期或无证入境的中国公民，迫使他们面临完整的刑罚，无法获得其他人可以享有的替代判决选项。这可能导致即使是轻微违法也会面临更长的监禁期和更严重的后果。

HB2587法案实施了一个医疗保健追踪系统，要求医院记录和报告与治疗未经授权移民相关的费用。该法案要求在医院入院登记时披露移民身份，这可能会为无合法身份的中国移民获取医疗保健服务设置障碍。这项要求可能会因为担心被发现或举报，而使未经授权的中国移民不敢寻求必要的医疗护理，可能导致严重的公共卫生后果。

这两项法案虽然没有明确针对中国移民，但创造了额外的审查和限制层面，可能会对身份不合规的中国公民产生不成比例的影响，迫使他们在寻求基本服务或法律保护时心存恐惧。

## Others

### Overview

These bills represent various legislative efforts in Texas focusing on state sovereignty, security, and foreign influence. While not exclusively targeting Chinese immigrants or nationals, several bills could have significant implications for the Chinese community in Texas.

Three bills (HB796, HB898, and SB80) propose the Texas Sovereignty Act, establishing a committee to review federal actions. This could potentially impact Chinese immigrants if Texas decides to challenge federal immigration policies or international agreements with China, potentially affecting their legal status and protections.

Security-focused legislation includes HB1170, which mandates transportation security threat analysis. This could lead to increased surveillance and screening of Chinese travelers and workers in the transportation sector. SB1348 establishes a committee specifically focused on potential conflicts with China, which could result in heightened scrutiny of Chinese-American businesses and individuals connected to Chinese infrastructure projects, particularly in the context of Taiwan-related scenarios.

HB1451 requires foreign agent registration disclosure for lobbyists, which could affect Chinese individuals or organizations involved in lobbying activities. HB2241 specifically restricts certain Chinese-manufactured firearms, including specific models like AK47 and AKS, creating a private right of action for violations with minimum damages of $10,000 per weapon.

Most notably, SB1349 creates criminal offenses for transnational repression, which could significantly impact Chinese nationals in the US. This bill specifically addresses concerns about foreign government agents engaging in harassment or surveillance, activities that have been associated with Chinese government efforts to influence overseas Chinese communities.

These bills collectively suggest an increasing focus on potential security threats and foreign influence, which could lead to enhanced scrutiny and potential challenges for Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans in Texas.


### Translation

这些法案代表德克萨斯州在州主权、安全和外国影响方面的各种立法努力。虽然这些法案并非专门针对中国移民或国民，但其中几项法案可能会对德州的中国社区产生重大影响。

三项法案（HB796、HB898和SB80）提出了《德克萨斯主权法案》，设立委员会审查联邦行动。如果德州决定挑战联邦移民政策或与中国的国际协议，这可能会影响中国移民的法律地位和保护。

安全相关立法包括HB1170，该法案要求进行运输安全威胁分析。这可能导致对中国旅客和运输部门工作人员加强监控和筛查。SB1348专门设立针对中国潜在冲突的委员会，特别是在台湾相关情况下，这可能导致对与中国基础设施项目有关联的中美企业和个人加强审查。

HB1451要求游说者披露外国代理人登记信息，这可能影响参与游说活动的中国个人或组织。HB2241具体限制某些中国制造的枪支，包括AK47和AKS等特定型号，违规者将面临每件武器至少1万美元的民事诉讼。

最值得注意的是，SB1349将跨国压制行为定为刑事犯罪，这可能对在美中国公民产生重大影响。该法案特别针对外国政府代理人的骚扰或监视行为，这些行为往往与中国政府影响海外华人社区的努力有关。

这些法案共同表明，德州正越来越关注潜在的安全威胁和外国影响，这可能导致德州的中国移民和华裔美国人面临更严格的审查和潜在挑战。
