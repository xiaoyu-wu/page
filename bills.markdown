We actively monitor the Texas Legislature Online to identify bills that target vulnerable immigrant communities from specific countries. Below, we provide categorized updates to help you stay informed. Each category includes an overview analyzing the potential impact of new bills, followed by a comprehensive list of proposed legislation.

Every bill is accompanied by an AI-generated summary, along with translations to ensure accessibility for affected immigrant communities. Additionally, the AI suggests potential legislative committees where these bills may be assigned. To ensure accuracy and reliability, we collaborate closely with legislative experts to review and validate these summaries. Updates will be made as new information becomes available.

## Alien land laws

### Overview

Alien land laws have historically been used to restrict property ownership by non-citizens, often with discriminatory intent. The current set of Texas bills represents a modern version of these restrictive policies, particularly targeting Chinese interests and nationals.

These bills create a comprehensive framework of restrictions on property ownership:

1. Direct Prohibitions on Property Purchase:
- Multiple bills (HB191, HB402, HB1566, HB1849, SB103, SB307) explicitly prohibit property purchases by entities from "designated countries," with China consistently named as a target.
- These restrictions affect Chinese government entities, organizations headquartered in China, and in some cases, individual Chinese nationals.

2. Agricultural Land Restrictions:
- HB518 and HB1743 specifically target agricultural land ownership, forcing Chinese nationals who are not Texas residents to divest their holdings by 2027.
- HB546 increases the tax burden on foreign-owned agricultural land by making it ineligible for open-space tax benefits.

3. Infrastructure and Resource Protection:
- HB243 enables property seizure near critical infrastructure, potentially affecting Chinese-owned properties.
- HB2034 restricts groundwater permits for Chinese entities and nationals.

4. Documentation and Verification Requirements:
- HB733 adds burdensome documentation requirements for property transactions involving non-citizens, including Chinese immigrants.

The discriminatory nature of these bills is evident in their targeted approach toward specific nationalities, particularly Chinese. While some bills exempt U.S. citizens and permanent residents of Chinese descent, they create significant barriers for Chinese nationals legally residing in the U.S. on temporary visas, Chinese businesses, and investors. The cumulative effect could lead to:
- Forced property divestiture
- Criminal penalties and substantial fines
- Increased difficulty in conducting business
- Higher tax burdens
- Limited access to natural resources
- Creation of a hostile environment for Chinese immigrants and investors

外国人土地法历来被用于限制非公民的房地产所有权，往往带有歧视性意图。目前这些德克萨斯州的法案代表了这些限制性政策的现代版本，特别针对中国利益和中国公民。

这些法案创建了一个全面的产权限制框架：

1. 直接禁止购买房地产：
- 多项法案(HB191、HB402、HB1566、HB1849、SB103、SB307)明确禁止来自"指定国家"的实体购买房地产，其中中国被持续点名。
- 这些限制影响中国政府实体、总部设在中国的组织，在某些情况下还包括中国公民个人。

2. 农业用地限制：
- HB518和HB1743特别针对农业用地所有权，强制非德州居民的中国公民在2027年前出售其持有的土地。
- HB546通过取消外国人拥有的农业用地的开放空间税收优惠，增加了其税收负担。

3. 基础设施和资源保护：
- HB243允许没收靠近关键基础设施的房产，可能影响中国人拥有的房产。
- HB2034限制中国实体和公民获取地下水许可。

4. 文件和验证要求：
- HB733为非公民（包括中国移民）的房地产交易增加了繁重的文件要求。

这些法案的歧视性质体现在它们针对特定国籍，特别是中国人的做法上。虽然一些法案豁免了华裔美国公民和永久居民，但它们为持临时签证的中国公民、中国企业和投资者设置了重大障碍。累积效应可能导致：
- 被迫出售房产
- 刑事处罚和巨额罚款
- 经商难度增加
- 更高的税收负担
- 获取自然资源受限
- 为中国移民和投资者营造敌对环境

## Education

### Overview

Education bills in Texas typically focus on curriculum standards, funding allocation, and admission policies. The current set of bills presents several concerning developments that could significantly impact Chinese and other immigrant communities.

Multiple bills (HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324) systematically target unauthorized immigrants by preventing them from qualifying for in-state tuition rates, even if they graduated from Texas high schools. These bills would force schools to reclassify previously qualified unauthorized immigrants as non-residents, directly affecting Chinese students without proper immigration status and potentially making higher education financially inaccessible.

HB371 takes a particularly harsh stance by restricting public school admission to only US citizens, nationals, and lawfully present aliens, potentially denying basic education to undocumented Chinese children unless federal funding is secured.

Several bills focus on foreign influence in education. HB173 prohibits Texas institutions from accepting gifts or donations from Chinese governmental entities, while HB1450 implements strict reporting requirements for all foreign sources of funding. These could impact Chinese-related programs and research opportunities.

HB1457 and SB453 mandate teaching about modern conflicts including potentially sensitive topics about China's history, which could create an uncomfortable learning environment for Chinese students and potentially foster bias or discrimination.

SB521's standardized testing requirements could disadvantage Chinese international students due to language barriers, while SB762's flag display restrictions could affect cultural expression in schools.

Two bills (HB380 and HB1401) strengthen penalties for improper educator-student relationships, affecting all educators including Chinese nationals working in Texas schools.

Overall, these bills represent a significant tightening of educational access for unauthorized immigrants and increased scrutiny of foreign influence in education, with both direct and indirect impacts on Chinese students, educators, and families in Texas.



### Translation

德克萨斯州的教育法案通常关注课程标准、资金分配和入学政策。目前这一系列法案呈现出几个值得关注的发展，可能会对中国和其他移民社区产生重大影响。

多项法案（HB160、HB232、HB424、HB979、HB1324）系统性地针对非法移民，阻止他们获得州内学费资格，即使他们是德克萨斯州高中毕业生。这些法案将迫使学校将先前符合资格的非法移民重新归类为非居民，直接影响没有适当移民身份的中国学生，可能使高等教育在经济上变得难以负担。

HB371采取了特别严厉的立场，将公立学校入学资格限制为美国公民、国民和合法居留的外国人，除非获得联邦资金支持，否则可能剥夺无证中国儿童接受基础教育的机会。

几项法案关注外国对教育的影响。HB173禁止德克萨斯州机构接受中国政府实体的捐赠或资助，而HB1450对所有外国资金来源实施严格的报告要求。这些可能影响与中国相关的项目和研究机会。

HB1457和SB453强制要求教授现代冲突史，包括可能敏感的中国历史话题，这可能会为中国学生创造不舒适的学习环境，并可能助长偏见或歧视。

SB521的标准化考试要求可能因语言障碍而对中国留学生不利，而SB762的旗帜展示限制可能影响学校中的文化表达。

两项法案（HB380和HB1401）加强了对教育者与学生不当关系的处罚，影响所有教育工作者，包括在德克萨斯州工作的中国教师。

总的来说，这些法案代表着对非法移民教育准入的显著收紧，以及对教育领域外国影响的加强审查，这将对德克萨斯州的中国学生、教育工作者和家庭产生直接和间接的影响。

## Contracting and Investment

### Overview

Contracting and investment bills typically regulate business operations, professional licensing, and financial transactions. This set of bills shows a significant focus on foreign entities, with several specifically targeting Chinese interests and potentially affecting Chinese immigrants and professionals in Texas.

Several bills offer opportunities for foreign professionals:
- HB296 and HB994 create pathways for foreign-educated physicians to obtain medical licenses, though HB994's fast-track program initially excludes China
- HB710 enables recognition of foreign occupational licenses and certifications

However, multiple bills implement restrictive measures targeting Chinese interests:
- HB1907 explicitly prohibits Texas government contracts with Chinese-owned technology companies
- HB1623 restricts tax benefits for entities from "designated countries," likely affecting Chinese businesses
- SB667 prohibits state retirement systems from investing in Chinese-affiliated entities
- HB1381 could restrict Chinese funding in higher education if China is designated as a "country of particular concern"

Financial and security measures that could impact Chinese nationals include:
- HB1049 and HB1056 establish gold/silver currency systems with provisions to restrict transactions with certain foreign entities
- SB778 creates a Texas Bitcoin Reserve with restrictions on foreign transactions
- SB780 establishes homeland security measures that could increase scrutiny of Chinese nationals in critical infrastructure sectors

While some bills like HB957 and SB871 are neutral and benefit all residents equally, the overall legislative pattern shows increased restrictions and scrutiny on Chinese-affiliated entities and individuals, potentially creating challenges for Chinese immigrants, professionals, and businesses operating in Texas.


### Translation

合同和投资法案通常规范商业运营、专业执照和金融交易。这组法案显著关注外国实体，其中多项特别针对中国利益，可能影响在德克萨斯州的中国移民和专业人士。

几项法案为外国专业人士提供机会：
- HB296和HB994为外国受教育的医生获取医疗执照创造途径，但HB994的快速通道项目初期排除中国
- HB710允许认可外国职业执照和认证

然而，多项法案实施了针对中国利益的限制措施：
- HB1907明确禁止德州政府与中国所有的技术公司签订合同
- HB1623限制"指定国家"实体的税收优惠，可能影响中国企业
- SB667禁止州退休系统投资中国相关实体
- 如果中国被指定为"特别关注国家"，HB1381可能限制中国在高等教育领域的资金

可能影响中国公民的金融和安全措施包括：
- HB1049和HB1056建立金银货币系统，并可能限制与某些外国实体的交易
- SB778建立德克萨斯比特币储备，限制外国交易
- SB780建立国土安全措施，可能加强对关键基础设施领域中国公民的审查

虽然HB957和SB871等法案是中性的，对所有居民都同等有利，但整体立法模式显示对中国相关实体和个人的限制和审查有所增加，可能给在德克萨斯州经营的中国移民、专业人士和企业带来挑战。

## Immigration

### Overview

These immigration-related bills from Texas primarily focus on border security and enforcement measures against unauthorized immigration. While most bills target the Texas-Mexico border, they have significant implications for all immigrants, including Chinese nationals.

Several bills (HB176, SB136, HB354) establish or strengthen border security measures through interstate compacts and new enforcement units. While these primarily target the southern border, the enhanced surveillance and enforcement mechanisms could affect Chinese travelers and immigrants throughout Texas.

Multiple bills introduce or increase criminal penalties for unauthorized presence:
- HB1017 creates new criminal offenses for improper entry
- HB1303 increases penalties and removes protective locations
- HB1832 establishes a tiered penalty system based on prior convictions
- HB1762 and SB552 make unauthorized immigrants ineligible for community supervision

Employment verification is tightened through HB1308, requiring E-verify use for larger employers, which could impact Chinese nationals working without proper authorization.

Healthcare-related bills include HB1310 (tracking costs for uninsured non-citizens) and SB179 (outreach to mixed-status families). These could affect Chinese immigrants' access to healthcare and their willingness to seek medical services.

One positive development is SB881, which creates opportunities for foreign-trained physicians, including those from China, to practice medicine in Texas under supervision.

The cumulative effect of these bills creates a more restrictive environment for unauthorized immigrants, with increased surveillance, stricter penalties, and fewer legal protections. While Chinese immigrants are not specifically targeted, those without proper documentation could face serious legal consequences, including arrest, detention, and deportation.


### Translation

这些德克萨斯州的移民相关法案主要集中在边境安全和打击非法移民方面。虽然大多数法案针对德克萨斯-墨西哥边境，但它们对所有移民（包括中国公民）都有重大影响。

多项法案（HB176、SB136、HB354）通过州际协议和新执法部门建立或加强边境安全措施。虽然这些主要针对南部边境，但加强的监控和执法机制可能影响到在德克萨斯州的中国旅客和移民。

多项法案引入或加重了非法居留的刑事处罚：
- HB1017为非法入境创建新的刑事犯罪
- HB1303加重处罚并取消保护地点
- HB1832基于先前定罪建立分级处罚制度
- HB1762和SB552使非法移民无法获得社区监督

HB1308通过要求大型雇主使用E-verify系统加强就业核查，这可能影响没有适当工作许可的中国公民。

医疗保健相关法案包括HB1310（追踪未投保非公民的医疗成本）和SB179（针对混合身份家庭的宣导）。这些可能影响中国移民获得医疗服务的机会和意愿。

一个积极的发展是SB881，为包括中国在内的外国培训的医生创造了在德克萨斯州在监督下执业的机会。

这些法案的累积效应为非法移民创造了更具限制性的环境，加强了监控，严格了处罚，减少了法律保护。虽然这些法案并非专门针对中国移民，但那些没有适当文件的人可能面临严重的法律后果，包括逮捕、拘留和驱逐出境。

## Others

### Overview

These bills cover a wide range of regulatory areas and have varying degrees of impact on Chinese immigrants and nationals in the United States. Several bills warrant particular attention due to their potential effects on the Chinese community:

Immigration and Documentation:
- HB566 directly affects Chinese immigrants by specifying acceptable documents for driver's license applications, including various immigration documents.

State Sovereignty and Federal Oversight:
- Multiple bills (HB796, HB898, SB80) establish Texas' authority to review federal actions, which could impact Chinese immigrants if federal immigration policies are deemed unconstitutional by Texas.
- HB1982 adds restrictions on federal law enforcement, potentially affecting investigations involving Chinese nationals.

Security and Monitoring:
- HB1170 requires analysis of transportation security threats from "foreign actors," which could lead to increased scrutiny of Chinese travelers.
- HB1274 modifies procedures for intelligence databases related to foreign terrorist organizations, affecting due process rights.
- HB1451 requires disclosure of foreign agent registration, affecting Chinese individuals involved in lobbying.

Legal Rights:
- HB1394 limits the ability of foreign citizens to pursue religious freedom claims against Texas in federal courts.
- HB991 restricts access to abortion-related information and services, affecting all residents including Chinese nationals.

While many bills (like HB316, HB495, HB1675) have no specific impact on Chinese immigrants, the cumulative effect of these regulations, particularly those related to state sovereignty and security measures, could create additional scrutiny and barriers for Chinese nationals and Chinese Americans in Texas.


### Translation

这些法案涵盖了广泛的监管领域，对在美国的中国移民和国民有不同程度的影响。以下几个法案因其对中国社区的潜在影响值得特别关注：

移民和证件：
- HB566直接影响中国移民，具体规定了驾驶执照申请的可接受文件，包括各种移民文件。

州主权和联邦监督：
- 多项法案（HB796、HB898、SB80）确立了德克萨斯州审查联邦行动的权力，如果联邦移民政策被德州认定为违宪，可能会影响中国移民。
- HB1982对联邦执法施加限制，可能影响涉及中国公民的调查。

安全和监控：
- HB1170要求分析来自"外国行为者"的交通安全威胁，可能导致对中国旅客加强审查。
- HB1274修改了与外国恐怖组织相关的情报数据库程序，影响正当程序权利。
- HB1451要求披露外国代理人登记，影响参与游说活动的中国个人。

法律权利：
- HB1394限制外国公民在联邦法院对德克萨斯州提起宗教自由诉讼的能力。
- HB991限制获取堕胎相关信息和服务，影响包括中国公民在内的所有居民。

虽然许多法案（如HB316、HB495、HB1675）对中国移民没有特定影响，但这些法规的累积效应，特别是与州主权和安全措施相关的法规，可能会对德克萨斯州的中国公民和华裔美国人造成额外的审查和障碍。
