We actively monitor the Texas Legislature Online to identify bills that target vulnerable immigrant communities from specific countries. Below, we provide categorized updates to help you stay informed. Each category includes an overview analyzing the potential impact of new bills, followed by a comprehensive list of proposed legislation.

Every bill is accompanied by an AI-generated summary, along with translations to ensure accessibility for affected immigrant communities. Additionally, the AI suggests potential legislative committees where these bills may be assigned. To ensure accuracy and reliability, we collaborate closely with legislative experts to review and validate these summaries. Updates will be made as new information becomes available.

## Alien land laws

### Overview

Alien land laws historically have been used to restrict property ownership rights of non-citizens, often targeting specific ethnic or national groups. The current set of Texas bills represents a discriminatory approach primarily targeting Chinese nationals and entities, reminiscent of historical anti-Asian legislation.

These bills can be categorized into several overlapping restrictions:

1. General Property Ownership Restrictions:
- Multiple bills (HB191, HB1566, HB1849, HB2389, HB2536, SB103) explicitly prohibit Chinese citizens, entities, and government organizations from purchasing real property in Texas.
- HB2628 and HB2752 take a broader approach by restricting foreign organizations generally.
- HB733 adds burdensome documentation requirements for all non-citizens in residential property transactions.

2. Agricultural Land Focus:
- HB518, HB1743, and SB1063 specifically target agricultural land ownership by foreign entities, with direct impact on Chinese nationals and businesses.
- HB546 increases tax burden on foreign-owned agricultural and open-space land through tax code modifications.

3. Infrastructure and Resource Protection:
- HB243 enables property seizure near critical infrastructure.
- HB2034 restricts groundwater permits for entities from "designated countries."

The potential impact on Chinese individuals and communities is severe:
- Chinese nationals who aren't U.S. permanent residents face complete prohibition from property ownership
- Chinese businesses face operational restrictions and forced divestiture of existing properties
- Even Chinese permanent residents may face increased scrutiny and documentation requirements
- Chinese agricultural investments would be effectively banned
- Some bills (like HB1743) force divestiture of existing properties by 2027
- Criminal penalties and substantial fines for violations could create a chilling effect even on permitted activities

These bills collectively create a hostile environment for Chinese investment and property ownership in Texas, potentially affecting even legal residents and naturalized citizens of Chinese descent through increased scrutiny and discrimination.


### Translation

外国人土地法历来被用于限制非公民的房地产所有权，通常针对特定的族裔或国籍群体。目前这套德克萨斯州的法案代表了一种歧视性方针，主要针对中国公民和实体，让人想起历史上的反亚裔立法。

这些法案可以分为几个重叠的限制类别：

1. 一般产权限制：
- 多项法案（HB191、HB1566、HB1849、HB2389、HB2536、SB103）明确禁止中国公民、实体和政府组织在德克萨斯购买房地产。
- HB2628和HB2752采取更广泛的方式限制外国组织。
- HB733为所有非公民的住宅物业交易增加了繁重的文件要求。

2. 农业用地重点：
- HB518、HB1743和SB1063特别针对外国实体的农业用地所有权，直接影响中国公民和企业。
- HB546通过税法修改增加外国人拥有的农业和开放空间用地的税收负担。

3. 基础设施和资源保护：
- HB243允许没收关键基础设施附近的房产。
- HB2034限制"指定国家"实体的地下水许可。

对中国个人和社区的潜在影响严重：
- 非美国永久居民的中国公民完全被禁止拥有房产
- 中国企业面临经营限制和被迫出售现有房产
- 即使是中国永久居民也可能面临更严格的审查和文件要求
- 中国农业投资将被实际禁止
- 一些法案（如HB1743）要求在2027年前出售现有房产
- 违规将面临刑事处罚和巨额罚款，可能对即使是允许的活动也产生寒蝉效应

这些法案共同为中国在德克萨斯州的投资和房地产所有权创造了一个敌对环境，甚至可能通过增加审查和歧视影响到合法居民和入籍的华裔美国公民。

## Education

### Overview

Education bills typically focus on curriculum standards, funding allocation, and student eligibility criteria. However, this set of Texas bills reveals a concerning pattern of restrictions targeting international students and foreign academic collaboration, with particular implications for Chinese nationals.

Several bills (HB160, HB232, HB424, HB979, HB1324) systematically restrict unauthorized immigrants' access to in-state tuition rates, requiring schools to reclassify previously qualified students as non-residents. This directly impacts Chinese students without proper immigration status, potentially making higher education financially inaccessible.

HB371 goes further by limiting public school admission to only US citizens and legally present aliens, potentially denying basic education to undocumented Chinese children unless federal funding is secured.

A significant focus on foreign influence monitoring is evident through HB173, HB1450, and SB1067, which prohibit accepting gifts or donations from Chinese government entities and require detailed reporting of foreign funding sources. This could severely impact Chinese-related academic programs and research opportunities.

HB2595 and SB1273 specifically target academic collaboration with "foreign adversaries," including China, implementing strict restrictions and establishing surveillance mechanisms. These bills could create a hostile environment for Chinese researchers and academics in Texas institutions.

Curriculum-focused bills (HB1457 and SB453) mandate teaching about sensitive topics in Chinese history, potentially affecting how Chinese students and immigrants are perceived in educational settings.

Even seemingly neutral bills like SB762 regarding flag displays could impact cultural expression within educational institutions.

The collective impact of these bills creates a multi-layered system of restrictions and surveillance that could significantly affect Chinese students, researchers, and academics in Texas, potentially limiting educational opportunities and creating an atmosphere of suspicion and discrimination.


### Translation

教育法案通常关注课程标准、资金分配和学生资格标准。然而，这些德克萨斯州法案显示出一个令人担忧的模式，针对国际学生和国际学术合作设置限制，特别影响中国公民。

多项法案（HB160、HB232、HB424、HB979、HB1324）系统性地限制未获授权移民享受州内学费待遇，要求学校将先前符合资格的学生重新归类为非居民。这直接影响没有适当移民身份的中国学生，可能使高等教育在经济上变得难以负担。

HB371更进一步限制公立学校入学资格仅限于美国公民和合法居留的外国人，除非获得联邦资金支持，否则可能剥夺无证中国儿童接受基础教育的机会。

通过HB173、HB1450和SB1067，显示出对外国影响力监控的重视，禁止接受来自中国政府实体的捐赠，并要求详细报告外国资金来源。这可能严重影响与中国相关的学术项目和研究机会。

HB2595和SB1273特别针对与"外国对手"（包括中国）的学术合作，实施严格限制并建立监控机制。这些法案可能在德克萨斯州教育机构中为中国研究人员和学者创造敌对环境。

课程相关法案（HB1457和SB453）强制要求教授中国历史敏感话题，可能影响教育环境中对中国学生和移民的看法。

即使是像SB762这样关于旗帜展示的看似中立的法案也可能影响教育机构内的文化表达。

这些法案的综合影响创造了一个多层次的限制和监控系统，可能显著影响在德克萨斯州的中国学生、研究人员和学者，潜在限制教育机会，并创造怀疑和歧视的氛围。

## Contracting and Investment

### Overview

These bills primarily focus on regulating business contracts, investments, and economic relationships with foreign entities, with a particular emphasis on national security concerns. The legislation package demonstrates a clear pattern of restricting Chinese involvement in Texas's economy and infrastructure.

Several bills directly target Chinese business interests and investments:
- HB1907, HB2403, and HB2409 specifically prohibit Texas governmental entities from contracting with Chinese companies for IT services, affecting Chinese-owned businesses and Chinese professionals in the tech sector.
- HB2244 bans purchasing electric vehicles or components from Chinese-connected companies.
- SB934 prohibits Chinese involvement in critical electric grid equipment.
- SB667 prevents Texas state retirement systems from investing in Chinese-affiliated entities.

Other bills create broader restrictions that could impact Chinese nationals and entities:
- HB1049 and HB1056 establish a gold/silver currency system with provisions that could restrict transactions with foreign entities deemed problematic.

- HB1623 restricts tax benefits for entities from "designated countries."
- HB2003 increases scrutiny on foreign investments in rail projects.
- HB2527 and HB2912 prohibit lobbying activities on behalf of Chinese interests.

The collective impact on Chinese immigrants, students, and professionals in Texas could be substantial, potentially affecting their ability to:
- Operate businesses in technology and infrastructure sectors
- Receive educational funding
- Participate in government contracts
- Access certain financial services
- Engage in lobbying or legal actions
- Receive state tax benefits

## Immigration

### Overview

Immigration legislation typically focuses on regulating the entry, residence, and rights of non-citizens within a jurisdiction. These Texas bills represent a broader trend of increasing restrictions on undocumented immigrants' access to public services and legal protections.

HB1762 creates a more punitive criminal justice environment for undocumented immigrants by eliminating alternatives to incarceration. This would directly impact Chinese nationals who have overstayed their visas or entered without inspection, forcing them to face full sentences without the possibility of probation or deferred adjudication. This could be particularly concerning for Chinese students or workers who may have inadvertently fallen out of status.

HB2587 introduces a healthcare tracking system that could create barriers to medical care access for undocumented immigrants, including Chinese nationals. By requiring hospitals to document immigration status, this bill may discourage unauthorized Chinese immigrants from seeking necessary medical care due to fear of detection or reporting. The data collection requirement could also contribute to discrimination and profiling of Asian patients in healthcare settings.

Both bills, while not explicitly targeting Chinese immigrants, could disproportionately affect vulnerable members of the Chinese community in Texas, particularly those who have fallen out of status or are awaiting adjustment of their immigration status. These measures could create additional barriers to accessing essential services and legal protections for Chinese immigrants.


### Translation

移民立法通常侧重于规范非公民在特定管辖区内的入境、居留和权利。这些德克萨斯州的法案代表了一个更广泛的趋势，即加强对无证移民获取公共服务和法律保护的限制。

HB1762通过取消监禁替代方案，为无证移民创造了一个更具惩罚性的刑事司法环境。这将直接影响签证逾期或未经检查入境的中国公民，迫使他们面临完整刑期，而没有缓刑或延期裁决的可能性。这对可能无意中失去合法身份的中国留学生或工作者来说尤其令人担忧。

HB2587引入了一个医疗保健追踪系统，可能会为无证移民（包括中国公民）获取医疗服务设置障碍。通过要求医院记录移民身份，这项法案可能会因担心被发现或举报而阻止无证中国移民寻求必要的医疗护理。数据收集要求还可能导致医疗环境中对亚裔患者的歧视和刻板印象。

这两项法案虽然没有明确针对中国移民，但可能会对德克萨斯州中国社区中的弱势群体造成不成比例的影响，特别是那些已经失去合法身份或正在等待调整移民身份的人。这些措施可能会为中国移民获取基本服务和法律保护设置额外障碍。

## Others

### Overview

These bills represent various regulatory measures in Texas focusing on state sovereignty, security, and firearms control. While not explicitly discriminatory against Chinese immigrants, several bills could have significant indirect impacts on Chinese nationals and Chinese Americans.

HB796, HB898, and SB80 are essentially the same Texas Sovereignty Act, which could potentially affect Chinese immigrants if Texas decides to challenge federal immigration policies or international agreements with China. This could create uncertainty regarding the legal status and rights of Chinese immigrants in Texas.

HB1170's focus on transportation security and "foreign actors" could lead to increased surveillance and scrutiny of Chinese travelers and transportation workers, potentially resulting in discriminatory practices or racial profiling.

HB1451 imposes new disclosure requirements for foreign agents, which could affect Chinese individuals or organizations involved in lobbying activities, potentially creating additional barriers for Chinese community advocacy.

HB2241, while primarily a firearms control measure, specifically names Chinese-manufactured weapons among prohibited assault weapons. Though not directly targeting Chinese individuals, it could impact Chinese-owned businesses dealing in firearms and create a perception of targeting Chinese products.

These bills collectively could create a more challenging environment for Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans in Texas, potentially affecting their daily lives, business activities, and civil rights through increased scrutiny and regulatory barriers.


### Translation

这些法案代表德克萨斯州在州主权、安全和枪支管制方面的各种监管措施。虽然这些法案没有明确歧视中国移民，但几项法案可能会对中国公民和美籍华人产生重大的间接影响。

HB796、HB898和SB80本质上是相同的德克萨斯主权法案，如果德克萨斯州决定挑战联邦移民政策或与中国的国际协议，可能会影响中国移民。这可能会给德克萨斯州中国移民的法律地位和权利带来不确定性。

HB1170关注运输安全和"外国行为者"，可能导致对中国旅客和运输工作者加强监视和审查，潜在造成歧视性做法或种族定性。

HB1451对外国代理人施加新的披露要求，这可能影响参与游说活动的中国个人或组织，可能为中国社区倡议活动制造额外障碍。

HB2241虽主要是枪支管制措施，但特别将中国制造的武器列入禁止的突击武器之列。虽然不直接针对中国个人，但可能影响从事枪支交易的中国企业，并造成针对中国产品的印象。

这些法案共同可能会为德克萨斯州的中国移民和美籍华人创造更具挑战性的环境，通过加强审查和监管障碍，可能影响他们的日常生活、商业活动和公民权利。
