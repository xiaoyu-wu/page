You must register in advance - please don't just show up for the bus. This is mainly to prevent seating shortages if not reserved beforehand.

## URGENT: Call to Oppose

# SB17 已经火速通过了参议院，进入众议院，推进速度飞快

SB17 has swiftly passed the Senate and moved to the House of Representatives, progressing at a rapid pace.

这个提案将限制华人（非绿卡）和中国企业买房，仅豁免自住房（造成华人无法换房，购房时被区别对待）。

This proposal will restrict Chinese nationals (non-green card holders) and Chinese enterprises from purchasing property, with exemptions only for primary residences (resulting in Chinese nationals being unable to change homes and being treated differently when purchasing property).

## HB17、HB1849 和 HB2536 是三个一模一样的提案

HB17, HB1849, and HB2536 are three identical proposals.

他们都禁止中国企业和中国公民（非绿卡）在德州购置任何房产（包括住宅物业、商业物业、工业物业、农田等），允许政府没收私人财产。如果违规买房，将遭遇刑事重罪加罚款。这个提案已经得到54位众议院共和党议员的联署支持。

They all prohibit Chinese enterprises and Chinese citizens (non-green card holders) from purchasing any property in Texas (including residential, commercial, industrial properties, farmland, etc.), and allow the government to confiscate private property. Violators will face criminal felony charges and fines. This proposal has already garnered the support of 54 Republican House members.

## 目前，HB17 等提案都被分到 House Committee on Homeland Security, Public Safety & Veterans' Affairs

Currently, HB17 and other proposals have been assigned to the House Committee on Homeland Security, Public Safety & Veterans' Affairs.

且 HB17 作者 Cole Hefner 就是该组委会主席。这些提案随时会举行听证会！

Moreover, Cole Hefner, the author of HB17, is the chairman of this committee. Hearings for these proposals could be held at any time!

## 请大家一定要积极行动起来！

Everyone must take action!

只要是德州居民，无论任何签证，都可以拨打电话给议员施压。接通电话以后告诉他们：

As long as you are a Texas resident, regardless of your visa status, you can call your representatives to pressure them. When you get through, tell them:

> I am calling to oppose SB17, HB17, HB1849, and HB2536! If you vote for this bill, you are a racist, you hate Chinese Americans, and we will let everyone know.

## 先拨打自己选区的 Texas House Representative

>  
> As an immigrant and a member of this community, I am deeply concerned about the message this bill sends and the potential for increased discrimination and hostility toward individuals and families like mine.  
>
> If enacted, this bill will damage Texas’ reputation as a business-friendly state, drive away skilled immigrant workers and investors, and harm our economy.  
>
> I urge you to stand against discrimination and vote NO on SB17.  
> 
> Thank you for your time and consideration.

> Sincerely,
