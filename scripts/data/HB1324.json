It removes provisions allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students who graduated from Texas high schools. Anyone not legally authorized to be in the US cannot be considered a state resident. This affects all immigrants without legal status, including Chinese students without proper documentation, who will be reclassified as non-residents and pay higher tuition rates.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u6559\u80b2\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u5c45\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u5b9a\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5fb7\u5dde\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6bd5\u4e1a\u7684\u65e0\u8bc1\u79fb\u6c11\u4eab\u53d7\u5dde\u5185\u5b66\u8d39\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\u4efb\u4f55\u672a\u83b7\u5f97\u5408\u6cd5\u5728\u7f8e\u5c45\u7559\u6743\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5dde\u5c45\u6c11\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u5408\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ca1\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u975e\u5c45\u6c11\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b66\u8d39\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
