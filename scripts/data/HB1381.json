This likely affects Chinese institutions and organizations, as China is typically designated as a \"country of particular concern\" for religious freedom violations. This could impact Chinese funding for research, academic partnerships, and exchange programs at Texas universities.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7981\u6b62\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u52a1\u537f\u6839\u636e\u300a\u56fd\u9645\u5b97\u6559\u81ea\u7531\u6cd5\u300b\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\"\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u56fd\u5bb6\"\u7b7e\u8ba2\u5408\u540c\u6216\u63a5\u53d7\u5176\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u5217\u4e3a\"\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u56fd\u5bb6\"\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u56fd\u673a\u6784\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u6cd5\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u91d1\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea4\u6d41\u9879\u76ee\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
