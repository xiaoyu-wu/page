The course covers sensitive topics like the Tiananmen Square protests, treatment of Uyghurs and Tibetans, and Falun Gong practitioners. While not directly restricting Chinese immigrants' rights, the mandatory curriculum could potentially influence students' perspectives on China and Chinese people.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u5fc5\u4fee\u534a\u5b66\u5206\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u51b2\u7a81\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5e7f\u573a\u6297\u8bae\u3001\u5bf9\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u65cf\u548c\u85cf\u65cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u4fee\u70bc\u8005\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5e76\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u9650\u5236\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u7684\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5fc5\u4fee\u8bfe\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
