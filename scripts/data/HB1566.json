This affects Chinese government entities, organizations headquartered in China, or those controlled by Chinese government. The attorney general can enforce this through court action and appoint receivers to manage/sell violating properties. Existing property ownership before the law is grandfathered.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7981\u6b62\u6765\u81ea\u88ab\u6307\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff08\u5982\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u60c5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d2d\u4e70\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u4ea7\u3002\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u603b\u90e8\u8bbe\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6216\u53d7\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u957f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u9662\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6267\u884c\u8be5\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4efb\u547d\u63a5\u7ba1\u4eba\u7ba1\u7406/\u51fa\u552e\u8fdd\u89c4\u8d22\u4ea7\u3002\u6cd5\u5f8b\u751f\u6548\u524d\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u6743\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
