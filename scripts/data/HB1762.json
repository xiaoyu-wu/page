While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, it affects any Chinese nationals who entered the US without proper inspection or failed to maintain their nonimmigrant status (like expired student/work visas). This could result in harsher punishments as they would be ineligible for probation alternatives.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u89c4\u5b9a\u975e\u6cd5\u79fb\u6c11\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7684\u5211\u4e8b\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u793e\u533a\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5ef6\u671f\u5224\u51b3\u7b49\u7f13\u5211\u5f85\u9047\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u975e\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u672a\u7ecf\u9002\u5f53\u68c0\u67e5\u5165\u5883\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u975e\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\uff08\u5982\u5b66\u751f\u7b7e\u8bc1/\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b7e\u8bc1\u8fc7\u671f\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7f13\u5211\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u4e25\u5389\u7684\u5904\u7f5a\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
