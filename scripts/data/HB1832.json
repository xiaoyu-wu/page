It particularly affects those with prior convictions, establishing a tiered penalty system ranging from Class B misdemeanors to first-degree felonies based on previous offenses. While the bill applies to all foreign nationals who enter or stay illegally, it does not specifically target Chinese immigrants. Any Chinese person with illegal status could be affected if they meet the criminal history criteria.<br><br>\u4e2d\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1a<br>\u8fd9\u9879\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\"\u5371\u9669\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u6cd5\u6848\"\u7684\u6cd5\u6848\u52a0\u91cd\u4e86\u975e\u6cd5\u5165\u5883\u6216\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u975e\u6cd5\u5c45\u7559\u7684\u5211\u4e8b\u5904\u7f5a\u3002\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u524d\u79d1\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u72af\u7f6a\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u4eceB\u7ea7\u8f7b\u7f6a\u5230\u4e00\u7ea7\u91cd\u7f6a\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u5904\u7f5a\u5236\u5ea6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u975e\u6cd5\u5165\u5883\u6216\u5c45\u7559\u7684\u5916\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u3002\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5982\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u72af\u7f6a\u8bb0\u5f55\u6761\u4ef6\u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u3002<br><br>Most likely committees:<br>1.
