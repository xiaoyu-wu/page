It sets a 5-year maximum imprisonment term for third-degree felony possession offenses and eliminates higher-degree felony classifications for larger quantities. The bill also prevents using prior drug possession convictions for sentence enhancement. While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, these changes would affect any Chinese nationals charged with drug possession in Texas.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7ba1\u5236\u836f\u54c1\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6bd2\u54c1\u6301\u6709\u7f6a\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5211\u7f5a\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u4e09\u7ea7\u91cd\u7f6a\u6301\u6709\u7f6a\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u76d1\u7981\u671f\u9650\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a5\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6301\u6709\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u91cd\u7f6a\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8fd8\u7981\u6b62\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u524d\u7684\u6bd2\u54c1\u6301\u6709\u5b9a\u7f6a\u8bb0\u5f55\u6765\u52a0\u91cd\u5211\u671f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u975e\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u66f4\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u56e0\u6bd2\u54c1\u6301\u6709\u88ab\u8d77\u8bc9\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
