It requires \"active efforts\" instead of just \"reasonable efforts\" to keep families together, raises the evidence standard to \"beyond reasonable doubt\" for terminating parental rights, and establishes a strict placement preference order prioritizing relatives and those with existing relationships. While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, these heightened standards would apply to all families, including Chinese families, in child welfare cases.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u670d\u52a1\u90e8(DFPS)\u5173\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u5b89\u7f6e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u8981\u6c42\u91c7\u53d6\"\u79ef\u6781\u52aa\u529b\"\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\"\u5408\u7406\u52aa\u529b\"\u6765\u7ef4\u7cfb\u5bb6\u5ead\u56e2\u805a\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec8\u6b62\u7236\u6bcd\u6743\u5229\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\"\u6392\u9664\u5408\u7406\u6000\u7591\"\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4eb2\u5c5e\u548c\u5df2\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5c06\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u798f\u5229\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
