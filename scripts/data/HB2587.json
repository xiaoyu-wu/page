Hospitals must include immigration status questions on intake forms and submit quarterly reports on the number of undocumented patients, associated costs, and impacts. While Chinese immigrants are not specifically targeted, those without lawful status would be tracked in this reporting system. Healthcare services cannot be denied based on immigration status.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7684\u533b\u9662\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u4e3a\u975e\u6cd5\u5c45\u7559\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u672a\u8865\u507f\u533b\u7597\u8d39\u7528\u3002\u533b\u9662\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u5165\u9662\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6bcf\u5b63\u5ea6\u63d0\u4ea4\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u65e0\u8bc1\u60a3\u8005\u4eba\u6570\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u5408\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u8005\u90fd\u5c06\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e00\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u5f97\u56e0\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u800c\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
