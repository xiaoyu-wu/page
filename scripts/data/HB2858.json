While not directly impacting Chinese immigrants, it creates a precedent for state-level guest worker programs that could potentially be expanded to include other countries in the future. The program requires workers to pass background checks, skills tests, and maintain proper documentation.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u5efa\u7acb\u4e34\u65f6\u5ba2\u5de5\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fd\u975e\u79fb\u6c11\u7b7e\u8bc1\u96c7\u7528\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5de5\u4eba\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e3a\u5dde\u7ea7\u5ba2\u5de5\u8ba1\u5212\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u5148\u4f8b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u8981\u6c42\u5de5\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u666f\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
