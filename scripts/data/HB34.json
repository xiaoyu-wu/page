While primarily targeting investments, this could indirectly impact Chinese nationals and Chinese Americans as their businesses might face increased scrutiny and reduced access to state investments, potentially affecting business opportunities and partnerships with state entities.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7981\u6b62\u5c06\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u8d44\u91d1\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u5b9a\u56fd\u5bb6\uff08\u4f0a\u6717\u3001\u671d\u9c9c\u3001\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fd\u5bb6\u6216\u5176\u516c\u6c11\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u4e3b\u8981\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7f8e\u534e\u4eba\u548c\u534e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u4e0e\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
