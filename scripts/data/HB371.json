While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, it affects all non-citizens/non-legal residents, including Chinese students without legal status. Schools can only admit undocumented students if the federal government agrees to pay their education costs. This significantly impacts access to public education for undocumented immigrants.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5c06\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\u5165\u5b66\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7ecf\u8d39\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u4ec5\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u3001\u56fd\u6c11\u6216\u5408\u6cd5\u5c45\u7559\u7684\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u6240\u6709\u975e\u516c\u6c11/\u975e\u5408\u6cd5\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ca1\u6709\u5408\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u5b66\u6821\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u540c\u610f\u652f\u4ed8\u5176\u6559\u80b2\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u8bc1\u79fb\u6c11\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u8fd9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u65e0\u8bc1\u79fb\u6c11\u83b7\u5f97\u516c\u5171\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
