Chinese citizens and Chinese-controlled entities would likely be impacted as China is regularly cited as a security risk. The ban applies to agricultural land, mines, quarries, minerals, and timber, but excludes residential homesteads and leasehold interests. Violators' property interests will be divested through court-appointed receivers.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7981\u6b62\u6765\u81ea\u88ab\u7f8e\u56fd\u60c5\u62a5\u673a\u6784\u8ba4\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5bf9\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6307\u5b9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d2d\u4e70\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u4ea7\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u5217\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u7981\u4ee4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u7528\u5730\u3001\u77ff\u573a\u3001\u91c7\u77f3\u573a\u3001\u77ff\u4ea7\u548c\u6797\u6728\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u4f4f\u5b85\u548c\u79df\u8d41\u6743\u76ca\u3002\u8fdd\u89c4\u8005\u7684\u8d22\u4ea7\u6743\u76ca\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u9662\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u7ba1\u4eba\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
