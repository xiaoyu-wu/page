It removes provisions allowing high school graduates with 3-year state residency to qualify as residents. Most significantly, it explicitly prohibits unauthorized immigrants from being considered state residents. This affects Chinese students and other international students without proper authorization to be in the US, requiring them to pay higher non-resident tuition rates.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u6559\u80b2\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u5c45\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u8ba4\u5b9a\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5dde\u5185\u5c45\u4f4f3\u5e74\u7684\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u83b7\u5f97\u5c45\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6cd5\u6848\u660e\u786e\u7981\u6b62\u672a\u83b7\u5f97\u5408\u6cd5\u5c45\u7559\u6743\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5dde\u5c45\u6c11\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u6ca1\u6709proper\u6388\u6743\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4ed6\u4eec\u652f\u4ed8\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u975e\u5c45\u6c11\u5b66\u8d39\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
