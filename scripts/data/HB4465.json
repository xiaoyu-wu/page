It allows licensed dietitians to practice across member states through a compact privilege. The bill does not specifically target Chinese immigrants or any other nationality, and would apply equally to all qualified dietitians regardless of national origin. Chinese dietitians with proper US licenses would have the same rights and privileges under this compact as other licensed dietitians.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8425\u517b\u5e08\u6267\u7167\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5dde\u8425\u517b\u5b66\u6267\u4e1a\u3002\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u6301\u8bc1\u8425\u517b\u5e08\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u7279\u6743\u5728\u6210\u5458\u5dde\u4e4b\u95f4\u6267\u4e1a\u3002\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5e76\u672a\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u6216\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u7c4d\u4eba\u58eb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5e73\u7b49\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5408\u683c\u7684\u8425\u517b\u5e08\u3002\u6301\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u7f8e\u56fd\u6267\u7167\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u8425\u517b\u5e08\u5728\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u5c06\u4eab\u6709\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6301\u8bc1\u8425\u517b\u5e08\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6743\u5229\u548c\u7279\u6743\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
