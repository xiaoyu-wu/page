While it doesn't affect admission, schools must track and quarterly report the number of non-lawfully present students, associated education costs, and required services. False statements or failure to properly document status becomes a Class A misdemeanor. This affects all immigrant students, including Chinese nationals, by requiring disclosure of their immigration status.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\u5728\u5165\u5b66\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u516c\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd/\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5165\u5b66\u8d44\u683c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u6821\u5fc5\u987b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e76\u6bcf\u5b63\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\u975e\u6cd5\u5c45\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6240\u9700\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u865a\u5047\u9648\u8ff0\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8eab\u4efd\u72b6\u6001\u5c06\u6784\u6210A\u7ea7\u8f7b\u7f6a\u3002\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u79fb\u6c11\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u62ab\u9732\u5176\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u72b6\u6001\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
