While not directly targeting Chinese immigrants, it could affect US-China military tensions by limiting Texas' ability to deploy National Guard in potential conflicts involving China, which may indirectly impact Chinese Americans' perceived loyalty or security status.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u88ab\u6d3e\u5f80\u56fd\u5916\u6267\u884c\u6218\u6597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u6218\u4e89\u5ba3\u8a00\u6216\u5b98\u65b9\u884c\u52a8\u6388\u6743\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u5fb7\u5dde\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u56fd\u6c11\u8b66\u536b\u961f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u534e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u88ab\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u4f4d\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
