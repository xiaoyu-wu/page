It removes provisions that allowed undocumented students who graduated from Texas high schools to qualify for in-state tuition. The bill explicitly states that individuals not authorized under federal law to be in the US cannot be considered Texas residents for tuition purposes. This affects all non-authorized immigrants, including Chinese students without proper documentation.<br><br>Chinese Translation:<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u6559\u80b2\u6cd5\u5178\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u5c45\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u5b9a\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5fb7\u5dde\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6bd5\u4e1a\u7684\u65e0\u8bc1\u5b66\u751f\u4eab\u53d7\u5dde\u5185\u5b66\u8d39\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u660e\u786e\u89c4\u5b9a\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672a\u83b7\u51c6\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5c45\u7559\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fb7\u5dde\u5c45\u6c11\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u5408\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ca1\u6709\u9002\u5f53\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u3002<br><br>Most likely committees:<br>1.
