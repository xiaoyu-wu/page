While not explicitly targeting Chinese researchers, the bill's focus on foreign espionage and prohibition of gifts from China could increase scrutiny and restrictions on Chinese scholars, researchers, and students at Texas universities. The council will conduct background checks on researchers and implement security measures to prevent intellectual property loss.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u7814\u7a76\u5b89\u5168\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e00\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\u578b\u5927\u5b66\u514d\u53d7\u5916\u56fd\u95f4\u8c0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5bf9\u5916\u56fd\u95f4\u8c0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee5\u53ca\u7981\u6b62\u63a5\u53d7\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u6350\u8d60\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5fb7\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u8005\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c06\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u80cc\u666f\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6d41\u5931\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
