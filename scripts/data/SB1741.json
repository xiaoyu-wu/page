It directly impacts Chinese interests by prohibiting universities from accepting gifts, grants, or donations from the Chinese government or entities controlled by it. All researchers must complete training on espionage prevention. Institutions must report foreign funding and establish a suspicious activity reporting system. While targeting Chinese government, this could create additional scrutiny for Chinese researchers and students.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u65e8\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u5728\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u53d1\u751f\u95f4\u8c0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u76d7\u7a83\u3002\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u5927\u5b66\u63a5\u53d7\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u6216\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u793c\u7269\u3001\u8d44\u52a9\u6216\u6350\u8d60\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5fc5\u987b\u5b8c\u6210\u95f4\u8c0d\u9884\u9632\u57f9\u8bad\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u5fc5\u987b\u62a5\u544a\u5916\u56fd\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u7591\u6d3b\u52a8\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
