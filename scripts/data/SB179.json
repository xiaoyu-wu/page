It affects Chinese immigrants as part of mixed-status families (where some family members are US citizens while others are not). The campaign will clarify eligibility requirements for citizens, qualified aliens, and permanent residents, and assure that a child's benefits won't affect their parent's immigration status.<br><br>\u4e2d\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1a<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5f00\u5c55\u516c\u5171\u5ba3\u4f20\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u8eab\u4efd\u5bb6\u5ead\uff08\u5373\u5bb6\u5ead\u6210\u5458\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u548c\u975e\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\uff09\u666e\u53ca\u533b\u7597\u8865\u52a9\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u5065\u5eb7\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u6cd5\u6848\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u8eab\u4efd\u5bb6\u5ead\u6210\u5458\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u3002\u8be5\u6d3b\u52a8\u5c06\u660e\u786e\u516c\u6c11\u3001\u5408\u683c\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5b50\u5973\u83b7\u5f97\u798f\u5229\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7236\u6bcd\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u3002<br><br>Most likely committees:<br>1.
