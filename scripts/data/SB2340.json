While not explicitly targeting Chinese entities, it could disproportionately affect Chinese businesses operating in Texas by allowing stricter examination of their records and imposing criminal penalties for non-compliance. Entities that fail to comply risk losing their right to do business in Texas.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u5546\u4e1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u68c0\u5bdf\u957f\u8c03\u67e5\u5728\u518c\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5916\u56fd\u5728\u518c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6743\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u5730\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u65bd\u52a0\u5211\u4e8b\u5904\u7f5a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u7ecf\u8425\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e0d\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u53bb\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u5f00\u5c55\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u6743\u5229\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
