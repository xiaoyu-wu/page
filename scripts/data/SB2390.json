Chinese students are explicitly included as a subcategory under Asian. The data will cover academic achievement, graduation rates, attendance rates, languages spoken at home, and access to educational resources. This increased granularity in data collection could impact Chinese students by making their educational outcomes more visible and trackable.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u6559\u80b2\u5c40\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf/\u6c11\u65cf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u5217\u4e3a\u4e9a\u88d4\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u6db5\u76d6\u5b66\u4e1a\u6210\u5c31\u3001\u6bd5\u4e1a\u7387\u3001\u51fa\u52e4\u7387\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6210\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
