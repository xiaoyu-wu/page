While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, it creates a narrative associating immigrants with crimes, which could increase stigma and prejudice against all immigrant communities, including Chinese immigrants. The bill requires memorial markers to be funded by grants or donations.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5141\u8bb8\u5c06\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af-\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u8fb9\u5883\u5899\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u88ab\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\uff08\u975e\u516c\u6c11\uff09\u72af\u7f6a\u81f4\u6b7b\u7684\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u547d\u540d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c06\u79fb\u6c11\u4e0e\u72af\u7f6a\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u79fb\u6c11\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff09\u7684\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u7eaa\u5ff5\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u8bbe\u7acb\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u52a9\u91d1\u6216\u6350\u6b3e\u6765\u8d44\u52a9\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
