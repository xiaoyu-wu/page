While not directly targeting Chinese immigrants, it could impact Chinese nationals and Chinese Americans by requiring state employees to report interactions with \"foreign adversary\" representatives and prohibiting gifts/travel from them. This increased scrutiny may lead to discrimination or bias against Chinese individuals working with state agencies.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u8bbe\u7acb\u654c\u5bf9\u5916\u56fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6253\u51fb\u5916\u56fd\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5171\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7f8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u548c\u534e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u8981\u6c42\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u96c7\u5458\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\"\u5916\u56fd\u5bf9\u624b\"\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u7981\u6b62\u63a5\u53d7\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u793c\u7269/\u65c5\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a0\u5f3a\u5ba1\u67e5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e2a\u4eba\u906d\u53d7\u6b67\u89c6\u6216\u504f\u89c1\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
