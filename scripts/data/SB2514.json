While targeting CCP influence, it may impact Chinese Americans and immigrants by requiring state employees to report interactions with anyone representing \"foreign adversaries\". It prohibits state employees from accepting gifts/travel from foreign adversaries and creates criminal penalties. This increased scrutiny could lead to discrimination against Chinese Americans.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u654c\u5bf9\u5916\u56fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90e8\u95e8\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5916\u56fd\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5171\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7f8e\u534e\u4eba\u548c\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u8981\u6c42\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u96c7\u5458\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee3\u8868\"\u5916\u56fd\u5bf9\u624b\"\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7981\u6b62\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u96c7\u5458\u63a5\u53d7\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u56fd\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u793c\u7269/\u65c5\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u7acb\u5211\u4e8b\u5904\u7f5a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a0\u5f3a\u5ba1\u67e5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7f8e\u7c4d\u534e\u4eba\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
