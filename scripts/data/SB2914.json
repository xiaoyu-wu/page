Chinese speakers (both Mandarin and Cantonese) are explicitly included as target beneficiaries. The plan mandates translation of all materials, forms, and communications into Chinese (both traditional and simplified) if the Chinese-speaking population reaches 50,000 with 33% having limited English proficiency. This will positively impact Chinese immigrants' access to health and human services.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u5236\u5b9a\u533b\u7597\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u670d\u52a1\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u670d\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u4e2d\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u548c\u7ca4\u8bed\uff09\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u5217\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u53d7\u76ca\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8bb2\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u8fbe\u52305\u4e07\u4e14\u5176\u4e2d33%\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u8981\u6c42\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6750\u6599\u3001\u8868\u683c\u548c\u901a\u8baf\u5185\u5bb9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7e41\u4f53\u548c\u7b80\u4f53\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u83b7\u53d6\u533b\u7597\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u670d\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
