The course covers sensitive topics about China including the Communist Party's rise, Tiananmen Square protests, Tibet occupation, and treatment of Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners. While not directly restricting Chinese immigrants, the mandatory curriculum could potentially influence students' perspectives about China and Chinese people.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u5fc5\u4fee\u4e00\u95e8\u5173\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u534a\u5b66\u5206\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\u3001\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5e7f\u573a\u6297\u8bae\u3001\u897f\u85cf\u5360\u9886\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u65cf\u548c\u6cd5\u8f6e\u529f\u4fee\u70bc\u8005\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u9650\u5236\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
