While not explicitly targeting Chinese students, it affects international students including Chinese applicants by mandating test scores as a required factor, though not the sole criterion. For Chinese students, English proficiency tests remain a separate requirement not affected by the new standardized testing rules.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u5728\u672c\u79d1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u5165\u5b66\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8003\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8003\u8bd5\u6210\u7ee9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u7533\u8bf7\u8005\u5728\u5185\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b66\u751f\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ecd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8003\u8bd5\u89c4\u5219\u5f71\u54cd\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
