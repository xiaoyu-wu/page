While not directly targeting Chinese immigrants, it could affect cultural expression by limiting display of cultural/heritage flags that don't fall under the permitted categories. However, Chinese national flag would still be allowed as it qualifies under \"flags that represent a foreign country.\"<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u9650\u5236\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\u53ea\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65d7\u5e1c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u56fd\u56fd\u65d7\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6587\u5316/\u4f20\u7edf\u65d7\u5e1c\u5c06\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u5c55\u793a\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u56fd\u65d7\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u4ee3\u8868\u5916\u56fd\u7684\u65d7\u5e1c\"\u4ecd\u88ab\u5141\u8bb8\u5c55\u793a\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
