While not directly targeting Chinese immigrants, Section 411.556 requires monitoring potential threats to critical infrastructure, including from foreign entities, and Section 411.562 restricts commerce with Chinese military companies identified by US Defense Secretary. This could increase surveillance and scrutiny of Chinese nationals in sensitive sectors.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u5185\u8bbe\u7acb\u56fd\u571f\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u5dde\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8fb9\u5883\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c411.556\u6761\u8981\u6c42\u76d1\u63a7\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u56fd\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7b2c411.562\u6761\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u9632\u90e8\u957f\u8ba4\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u519b\u5de5\u4f01\u4e1a\u8fdb\u884c\u5546\u4e1a\u5f80\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u76d1\u89c6\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
