While not specifically targeting Chinese immigrants, it limits government powers during disasters by: 1) Requiring legislative approval to restrict business operations, 2) Limiting governor's authority to suspend laws, and 3) Preventing local disaster declarations from conflicting with state declarations. These changes could affect all residents, including Chinese immigrants, in how emergency responses are managed.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u653f\u5e9c\u6cd5\u5178\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3/\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u672a\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u529b\uff1a1\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u7acb\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u6279\u51c6\u624d\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5546\u4e1a\u7ecf\u8425\uff0c2\uff09\u9650\u5236\u5dde\u957f\u6682\u505c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u6743\u529b\uff0c3\uff09\u9632\u6b62\u5730\u65b9\u707e\u5bb3\u58f0\u660e\u4e0e\u5dde\u7ea7\u58f0\u660e\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u6709\u5c45\u6c11\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff09\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
