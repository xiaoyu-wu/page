While not directly targeting Chinese immigrants, it could affect all business owners including Chinese business owners by requiring legislative approval (rather than governor's executive order) to restrict or impair business operations during disasters or emergencies. The bill also clarifies definitions of disasters and emergencies, and limits local government authority during disasters.<br>", "translation": "<br>\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u707e\u96be\u5e94\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u4e1a\u4e3b\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u4e1a\u4e3b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6216\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9650\u5236\u6216\u5f71\u54cd\u5546\u4e1a\u8fd0\u8425\u9700\u8981\u7acb\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u6279\u51c6\uff08\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5dde\u957f\u884c\u653f\u547d\u4ee4\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u8fd8\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u548c\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u707e\u96be\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u529b\u3002<br>", "committees": "<br>1.
