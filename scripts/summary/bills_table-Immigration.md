|[HB1762](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1762)|<br>This bill makes illegal aliens ineligible for any form of community supervision or deferred adjudication in Texas criminal cases.

This could result in harsher punishments as they would be ineligible for probation alternatives.<br>|<br>该法案规定非法移民在德克萨斯州的刑事案件中不能获得社区监督或延期判决等缓刑待遇。虽然并非专门针对中国移民，但会影响所有未经适当检查入境或未能维持非移民身份（如学生签证/工作签证过期）的中国公民。由于他们将无法获得缓刑选择，这可能导致更严厉的处罚。<br>|<br>1.
