**SB 17 is un-American and anti-Texan.  Let’s keep Texas open for business.** 

1. **Harm to Texas Economy & Reputation**

    * **Disruption to Real Estate Markets**: Banning property ownership by foreign individuals and companies would destabilize real estate transactions across commercial, industrial, residential, and agricultural markets.  
    
    * **Excessive Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Compliance with SB 17 would introduce unnecessary red tape, leading to delays, increased transaction costs, and making Texas a less attractive place for investment and growth.  
    
    * **Impact on Major Trading Partners**: Texas' key trading partners—responsible for tens of billions in annual trade—would face unnecessary restrictions, diminishing international business and economic relationships. (Mainland China is Texas’ 3rd largest trading partner, which imported $26.467 billion from Texas in 2024\.)  
    
    * **Risk of Job Losses and Economic Setback**: Restricting property purchases would create a hostile environment for investors and entrepreneurs, prompting them to choose or relocate to more welcoming states, which could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions in economic growth. This runs counter to Texas' ongoing efforts to stimulate economic development.  
    
    * **Discouraging Skilled Foreign Talent**: SB 17 would discourage high-skilled foreign talent from coming to Texas, weakening the state's competitive edge in technology, manufacturing and other sectors.  
    
    * **Hurting Existing Texas Businesses**: Many existing Texas businesses would like to bring their upstream supply chains and reshore manufacturing to Texas to make them more competitive.  Texas could become a manufacturing powerhouse.  However, SB 17 runs counter to such efforts, hurting existing Texas businesses and making Texas less attractive for corporate relocation.    
    
    * **Damage to Texas’ Pro-Business Reputation**: This bill threatens Texas’ image as a pro-business hub, potentially pushing businesses to relocate to states with a more favorable climate for investment and innovation.  
    
    * **Texas' Legacy at Stake**: Texas should continue to champion its legacy as a leader in innovation, commerce, and economic prosperity, not impose unnecessary, harmful restrictions. We must protect the state’s “Open for Business” reputation.  
    
2. **SB 17 Will Not Achieve Its Stated Goals**  
     
    * The bill claims to “protect key land and natural resources from hostile counties and their actors” and to ensure national security.  However, there is no clear evidence to support that restricting property ownership will achieve these objectives.  
    
3. **Unclear Definitions and Practical Challenges**  
     
    * **Overly Broad Definition of Agricultural Land**: The bill defines “agricultural land” too broadly, leaving it unclear who will determine whether property is “suitable” for plant production or animal farming.  Many Texans grow their own fruits or raise animals on their properties for personal use, yet the broad definition could subject such properties to SB 17’s restrictions.  Additionally, properties leased for agricultural or farming purposes to gain agricultural tax exemptions but are otherwise located in the urban areas could be negatively impacted.  
    
    * **Expansion of Property Restrictions**: SB 17 now includes *commercial, industrial, and residential properties* under its restrictions, expanding beyond the provisions of SB 147 from 2023\.  However, there’s no evidence suggesting foreign ownership of these properties poses a national security threat.  The bill’s scope is overly broad and doesn’t align with its stated objectives.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around the Leasehold Exception**: The leasehold exception is confusing.  It is unclear what “improvements constructed on a leasehold” means.  
    
    * **Vague Definitions of “Risk”**: The bill includes terms such as “corporate espionage” and “public nuisance” under the definition of “risk to public health, safety, and welfare.”  How these will be determined is unclear, leaving too much room for interpretation and creating uncertainty.  An objective, justifiable test for “risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public” would be needed.   
    
    * **Nonsensical Provisions on “Bodily Injury”**: The bill also includes restrictions based on bodily injury, including introducing a dangerous disease or substance into an area.  This could lead to absurd situations where property owners are forced to sell their property due to minor incidents like a slip and fall or the common flu—undermining legal fairness.  
    
    * **Ambiguity Around Domicile**: The bill restricts property ownership for individuals "domiciled" in certain countries but fails to define “domicile,” creating confusion.  Under Texas law, domicile is typically based on physical presence and intent to stay permanently, yet federal immigration laws prevent certain visa holders (e.g., H-1B employment visa, F-1 student visa) from establishing domicile in the U.S.  It could take over ten years for a Chinese national with an H1-B employment visa to become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.  The bill makes the bill overly broad and unnecessarily burdensome for lawful residents working in and contributing to Texas economy.    
    
    * **Unaddressed Practical Issues**: Issues like inheritance, foreclosure, and foreign nationals’ collateral property ownership are not adequately addressed, which could lead to significant financial and legal complications.  
    
    * **Harsh Consequences for Violations**: The bill’s “forced sale” provision for violations is overly punitive, risking devastating financial losses and legal disputes.  
    
    * **Lack of Certainty**: The bill’s ambiguity and lack of pre-clearance mechanisms for transactions could deter foreign investments and talent from choosing Texas as their home or business location.  
    
    * **Lack of Protection for Service Providers**: The bill does not provide protection for title companies, real estate agents, attorneys and other service providers involved in real estate transactions.  This would create a chilling effect on these service providers.

4. **Violates Federal Preemption and the Constitution**

    * **Federal Oversight of Foreign Purchases**: The federal government already regulates foreign property transactions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), making Texas’ attempt to impose additional restrictions unconstitutional and legally void.  
    
    * **Legal Enforceability Issues**: Federal preemption prevents states from enacting conflicting or supplementary laws in areas already federally regulated, rendering SB 17 legally unenforceable.  
    
5. **Unjustified Association Between Individuals and Governments**  
     
    * **Punishing Individuals for Their Governments' Actions**: The bill unfairly targets individuals based on their home country’s government actions, contradicting American values of individual responsibility and equal protection under the law. Those individuals and businesses make the choice to call Texas home.   
    
    * **Dangerous Precedents**: This mirrors historical injustices such as Japanese internment during WWII, setting a dangerous precedent for racial and ethnic discrimination.  
    
6. **Likely Legal Violations**

    SB 17 discriminates based on national origin, violating several federal and state laws, including:

    * 14th Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)  
    
    * Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 3a (Prohibits discrimination based on national origin)  
    
    * Fair Housing Act (Prohibits housing discrimination)  
    
    * WTO Agreements (Potential violation of international trade laws)  
    
7. **Broader Discriminatory and Social Implications**

    * **Fostering Xenophobia**: By targeting specific nationalities, the bill fosters racial profiling, increasing discrimination against all Asian Americans—not just Chinese Americans—due to perceived ethnic similarity. This could lead to negative economic and social consequences for the AAPI community in Texas, including those born in Texas and U.S. citizens.  
    
    * **Dividing Communities**: The bill unjustly equates lawful immigrants with national security threats, creating an environment of fear, suspicion, and division among Texans.   
    
8. **Lessons from History**

    * **Repeating Past Mistakes**: Texas had alien land laws back in the 19-20th century restricting foreign land ownership but the state legislature abolished them in 1965 “on the grounds that they imposed **unreasonable and discriminatory restrictions** on alien ownership and militated against efforts by the state to entice foreign investment and stimulate economic development and industrial growth.”  Enacting SB 17 would repeat past mistakes and undo decades of progress, reversing Texas’ global standing and economic growth.  
    
    * **Learning from the Past**: Texas must learn from its own history and reject SB 17 to maintain its legacy as a beacon of opportunity, economic strength, and global leadership.  Keep Texas open for business\!
